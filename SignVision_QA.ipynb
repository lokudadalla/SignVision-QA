              "0     Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the sixteenth President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1861 until his assassination. As an outspoken opponent of the expansion of slavery in the United States, \"[I]n his short autobiography written for the 1860 presidential campaign, Lincoln would describe his protest in the Illinois legislature as one that 'briefly defined his position on the slavery question, and so far as it goes, it was then the same that it is now.\" This was in reference to the anti-expansion sentiments he had then expressed. Doris Kearns Goodwin, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln (2005) p. 91.  Holzer pg. 232.  Writing of the Cooper Union  speech, Holzer notes, \"Cooper Union proved a unique confluence of political culture, rhetorical opportunity, technological innovation, and human genius, and it brought Abraham Lincoln to the center stage of American politics at precisely the right time and place, and with precisely the right message: that slavery was wrong, and ought to be confined to the areas where it already existed, and placed on the 'course of ultimate extinction... .'\"  Lincoln won the Republican Party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year. During his term, he helped preserve the United States by leading the defeat of the secessionist Confederate States of America in the American Civil War. He introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery, issuing his Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1865.. Lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including Ulysses S. Grant. Historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the Republican Party well, bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. Lincoln successfully defused a war scare with the United Kingdom in 1861. Under his leadership, the Union took control of the border slave states at the start of the war. Additionally, he managed his own reelection in the 1864 presidential election.. Opponents of the war (also known as \"Copperheads\") criticized him for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans, an abolitionist faction of the Republican Party, criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. Even with these problems, Lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches; his Gettysburg Address is but one example of this. At the close of the war, Lincoln held a moderate view of Reconstruction, seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. His assassination in 1865 was the first presidential assassination in U.S. history and made him a martyr for the ideal of national unity.. Scholars now rank Lincoln among the top three U.S. Presidents, with the majority of those surveyed placing him first. He is noted for his lasting influence on U.S. politics, including a redefinition of republicanism.  As Diggins explains, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.\" John Patrick Diggins, The Lost Soul of American Politics: Virtue, Self-interest, and the Foundations of Liberalism (1986) p. 307. Foner (1970) p. 215 noted that, \"Lincoln stressed the moral basis of Republicanism.\" Jaffa (2000) p. 399, stresses Lincoln's emphasis on the Declaration of Independence as what Lincoln called the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism. See also McPherson (1992) pp.61-64.. Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, to Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks, two uneducated farmers. Lincoln was born in a one-room log cabin on the   Sinking Spring Farm, in southeast Hardin County, Kentucky (now part of LaRue County). This area was at the time considered the \"frontier.\" The name \"Abraham\" was chosen to commemorate his grandfather, who was killed in an American Indian raid in 1786. Donald (1995) p 21  His elder sister, Sarah Lincoln, was born in 1807; a younger brother, Thomas Jr, died in infancy. It is sometimes debated whether Lincoln had Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of the connective tissue characterized by long limbs and great physical stature.  Marfan syndrome: Introduction Aug 1, 2006. Symbolic log cabin at Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site.. For some time, Thomas Lincoln was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the Kentucky back country. He had purchased the Sinking Spring Farm in December of 1808 for $200 cash and assumption of a debt.  The farm site is now preserved as part of Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site.  The family belonged to a Baptist church that had seceded from a larger church over the issue of slavery. Though Lincoln was exposed to his parents' anti-slavery sentiment from a very young age, he never joined their church, or any other church for that matter.  As a youth he had little use for religion. Life of Abraham Lincoln, Colonel Ward H. Lamon, 1872 - portions reprinted in  Chapter VIII: Abraham Lincoln, Deist, and Admirer of Thomas Paine, From the book Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents by Franklin Steiner (1936). Lincoln was just seven years old when, in 1816, the family was forced to make a new start in Perry County (now in Spencer County), Indiana. He later noted that this move was \"partly on account of slavery,\" and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in Kentucky: Unlike land in the Northwest Territory, Kentucky never had a proper U.S. survey, and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property. Lincoln was only nine when his mother, then thirty-four years old, died of milk sickness. Soon afterwards, his father remarried  to Sarah Bush Johnston. Sarah Lincoln raised young Lincoln like one of her own children. Years later she compared Lincoln to her own son, saying \"Both were good boys, but I must say — both now being dead that Abe was the best boy I ever saw or ever expect to see.\" Lincoln was affectionate toward his stepmother, whom he would call \"Mother\" for the rest of his life, but he was distant from his father.  Donald, (1995) pp. 28, 152.. In 1830, after more economic and land-title difficulties in Indiana, the family settled on public land  /ref> in Macon County, Illinois. Some scholars believe that it was his father's repeated land-title difficulties and ensuing financial hardships that led young Lincoln to study law.  The following winter was desolate and especially brutal, and the family considered moving back to Indiana. The following year, when his father relocated the family to a new homestead in Coles County, Illinois, twenty-two-year-old Lincoln struck out on his own, canoeing down the Sangamon River to the village of New Salem in Sangamon County. Later that year, hired by New Salem businessman Denton Offutt and accompanied by friends, he took goods from New Salem to New Orleans via flatboat on the Sangamon, Illinois and Mississippi rivers. While in New Orleans, he may have witnessed a slave auction, though as a frequent visitor to Kentucky, he would have had several earlier opportunities to witness  similar sales.  Donald, (1995) ch. 2.. Lincoln's formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling. Largely self-educated, he read every book he could get his hands on, once walking.  just to borrow one  While his favorite book was The Life of George Washington, Lincoln mastered the Bible, Shakespeare, and English and American history, and developed a plain writing style that puzzled audiences more used to grandiose rhetoric. He was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an ax; some rails he had allegedly split in his youth were exhibited at the 1860 Republican National Convention, as the party celebrated the poor-boy-made-good theme. Lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals, even for food. Though he was unusually tall at  , 4 inches and strong, Lincoln spent so much time reading that some neighbors suspected he must be doing it to avoid strenuous manual labor.. Young Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln began his political career in 1832, at age 23, with an unsuccessful campaign for the Illinois General Assembly, as a member of the Whig Party.  He ran eighth in a field of 13 candidates.  The centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the Sangamon River. He believed that this would attract steamboat traffic, which would allow the sparsely populated, poorer areas along the river to flourish.. He was elected captain of an Illinois militia company drawn from New Salem during the Black Hawk War, and later wrote that he had not had \"any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction.\"  Thomas (1952) 32-34; Basler (1946) p. 551   Though he never saw combat, Lincoln did assist in burying the dead from the Battle of Stillman's Run the day after Major Isaiah Stillman's troops fled the field of battle.  Abraham Lincoln Online Retrieved on March 11, 2007. For several months, Lincoln ran a small store in New Salem, selling tea, coffee, sugar, salt, blue calico, brown muslin, straw hats and whiskey.  Beveridge (1928) 1:127-8  Later, he found work as village postmaster and as a surveyor.. In 1834, he won election to the state legislature, and after coming across the Commentaries on the Laws of England, began to teach himself law. Admitted to the bar in 1837, he moved to Springfield, Illinois, that same year and began to practice law with John T. Stuart. With a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and in his closing arguments, Lincoln became one of the most respected and successful lawyers in Illinois and grew steadily more prosperous.. He served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a representative from Sangamon County, and became a leader of the Illinois Whig party. In 1837, he made his first protest against slavery in the Illinois House, stating that the institution was \"founded on both injustice and bad policy.\"  Protest in Illinois Legislature on Slavery, p.75, March 3, 1837  It was also in this same year that Lincoln met Joshua Fry Speed, who would become his most intimate friend.. Lincoln wrote a series of anonymous letters, published in 1842 in the Sangamon Journal, mocking State Auditor and prominent Democrat James Shields. Shields would later become a U.S. senator, but when he learned that it was Lincoln who had been writing the barbs, he challenged him to a duel. As Shields was the challenger, Lincoln was granted the right to choose the weapon and specified \"Cavalry broad swords of the largest size.\" Much taller and with long arms, this gave him an overwhelming advantage over his opponent; however, the duel was called off at the last minute. Beveridge (1928) 1:349. Lincoln had been practicing with the broad sword.  Two years later, Lincoln entered law practice with William Herndon, a fellow Whig. In 1854, both men joined the fledgling Republican Party. Following Lincoln's death, Herndon began collecting stories about Lincoln and published them in Herndon's Lincoln.. The first photograph ever taken of Mary Lincoln, a daguerreotype by Shepherd in 1846.. On November 4 1842 Lincoln married Mary Todd, daughter of a prominent slave-owning family from Kentucky. The couple had four sons. Robert Todd Lincoln was born in Springfield, Illinois on 1 August, 1843. Their only child to survive into adulthood, young Robert attended Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard College. Robert died on July 26, 1926, in Manchester, Vermont.. The other Lincoln children were born in Springfield, Illinois, and died either during childhood or their teen years. Edward Baker Lincoln was born on March 10, 1846, and died on 1 February, 1850, also in Springfield. William Wallace Lincoln was born on December 21, 1850, and died on February 20, 1862 in Washington, D.C., during Pres. Lincoln's first term. Thomas \"Tad\" Lincoln was born on 4 April, 1853, and died on July 16, 1871 in Chicago.. Four of his wife's brothers fought for the Confederacy, with one wounded and another killed in action. Lieutenant David H. Todd, a half-brother of Mary Todd Lincoln, served as commandant of the Libby Prison camp during the war.. The first photograph ever taken of Abraham Lincoln, a daguerreotype taken by Shepherd in 1846.. A Whig and an admirer of party leader Henry Clay,  Lincoln was elected to a term in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1846. As a freshman House member, he was not a particularly powerful or influential figure. He spoke out against the Mexican-American War, which he attributed to President Polk's desire for \"military glory — that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood.\" He also challenged the President's claims regarding the Texas boundary and offered Spot Resolutions demanding to know on what \"spot\" on US soil that blood was first spilt.  Congressional Globe, 30th Session (1848) pp.93-95  In January of 1848, he was among the 82 Whigs who defeated 81 Democrats in a procedural vote on an amendment to send a routine resolution back to committee with instructions to add the words \"a war unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the President of the United States.\" The amendment passed, but the bill never reemerged from committee and was never finally voted upon.  House Journal, 30th Session (1848) pp.183-184. Lincoln later damaged his political reputation with a speech in which he declared, \"God of Heaven has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent, and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men, women, and children, and lay waste and pillage the land of the just.\" Two weeks later, President Polk sent a peace treaty to Congress. While no one in Washington paid any attention to Lincoln, the Democrats orchestrated angry outbursts from across his district, where the war was popular and many had volunteered. In Morgan County, resolutions were adopted in fervent support of the war and in wrathful denunciation of the \"treasonable assaults of guerrillas at home; party demagogues; slanderers of the President; defenders of the butchery at the Alamo; traducers of the heroism at San Jacinto.\"  Abe Lincoln resource page. Warned by his law partner, William Herndon, that the damage was mounting and irreparable, Lincoln decided not to run for reelection. In fact, in 1848 he campaigned vigorously for Zachary Taylor, the successful general whose atrocities he had denounced in January. Regardless, his statements were not easily forgotten, and would haunt him during the Civil War. These statements were also held against him when he applied for a position in the new Taylor administration. Instead, Taylor's people offered Lincoln various positions in the remote Oregon Territory, primarily the governorship. Acceptance of this offer would have ended his career in the rapidly growing state of Illinois, so Lincoln declined the position. Returning to Springfield, Lincoln gave up politics for several years and turned his energies to his law practice. During this time, he made many trips on horseback between various counties' courthouses. Beveridge, (1928) 1: 428-33; Donald (1995) p. 140-43.. In the 1920s historical markers were placed at the county lines along the route Lincoln traveled in the eight judicial district. This example is on the border of Piatt and DeWitt counties. By the mid-1850s, Lincoln's caseload focused largely on the competing transportation interests of river barges and railroads. In one prominent 1851 case, he represented the Alton & Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with a shareholder, James A. Barret. Barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to the railroad on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. Lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest, that the newer route proposed by Alton & Sangamon was superior and less expensive, and that accordingly, the corporation had a right to sue Barret for his delinquent payment. He won this case, and the decision by the Illinois Supreme Court was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the United States. Donald, (1995) ch. 6.. Possibly the most notable criminal trial of Lincoln's career as a lawyer came in 1858, when he defended William \"Duff\" Armstrong, who has been charged with murder. The case became famous for Lincoln's use of judicial notice--a rare tactic at that time--to show that an eyewitness had lied on the stand. After the witness testified to having seen the crime by moonlight, Lincoln produced a Farmers' Almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle that it could not have provided enough illumination to see anything clearly. Based almost entirely on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted. Donald (1995), 150-51. Lincoln was involved in more than 5,100 cases in Illinois alone during his 23-year legal career. Though many of these cases involved little more than filing a writ, others were more substantial and quite involved. Lincoln and his partners appeared before the Illinois State Supreme Court more than 400 times. During one trial, Lincoln's voir dire included a question to prospective jurors as to whether they were acquainted with counsel for the other side. When a few of them turned out to know the other lawyer, the judge interrupted, saying, \"Mr. Lincoln, you are wasting the time of the court. The fact that a prospective juror knows your opponent does not disqualify him.\". \"No, Your Honor, I understand that,\" Lincoln answered. \"I'm afraid that some of them might not know him, which would place me at a disadvantage.\". Lincoln returned to politics in response to the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854), which expressly repealed the limits on slavery's extent as determined by the Missouri Compromise (1820). Illinois Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, the most powerful man in the Senate, proposed popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse, and incorporated it into the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory, rather than have such a decision imposed on them by Congress.  Donald, (1995) ch. 7.. In a speech against the act, on October 16 1854, delivered in Peoria, Lincoln first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day:. Drawing on remnants of the old Whig, Free Soil, Liberty and Democratic parties, he was instrumental in forming the new Republican Party. In a stirring campaign, the Republicans carried Illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. Lincoln was the obvious choice, but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an ex-Democrat Lyman Trumbull.. In 1857-58, Douglas broke with President Buchanan, leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state. Accepting the Republican nomination for Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered his famous speech: \"'A house divided against itself cannot stand.'(Mark 3:25) I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.\"  A House Divided Against Itself Cannot Stand, June 1858  The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the north.. The 1858 campaign featured the Lincoln-Douglas debates, a nationally famous contest on slavery. Lincoln warned that the \"Slave Power\" was threatening the values of republicanism, while Douglas emphasized the supremacy of democracy, as set forth in his Freeport Doctrine, which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not. Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature reelected Douglas to the Senate. Nevertheless, Lincoln's eloquence transformed him into a national political star.. During the debates of 1858, the issue of race was often discussed. During a time period when few believed in racial egalitarianism, Stephen Douglas informed the crowds, \"If you desire Negro citizenship… if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves… then support Mr. Lincoln and the Black Republican party, who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro.\"  First Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Ottawa, Illinois, August 21, 1858  Lincoln countered that he was \"not in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races.\"  Fourth Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Charleston, Illinois, September 18, 1858  His opposition to slavery was opposition to the Slave Power, though this would change during the course of the Civil War. Donald, (1995) ch. 8.. On May 9-10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur. At this convention, Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.. \"The Rail Candidate,\" Lincoln's 1860 candidacy is held up by slavery issue (slave on left) and party organization (New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley on right). Photo of Lincoln taken February 27, 1860 in New York City by Mathew Brady, the day of his famous Cooper Union speech.. Entering the presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog, Lincoln was eventually chosen as the Republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. His expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase. His \"Western\" origins also appealed to the newer states: other contenders, especially those with more governmental experience, had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states, while Lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the West. Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government. Yet despite his Southern connections (his in-laws owned slaves), Lincoln misunderstood the depth of the revolution underway in the South and the emergence of Southern nationalism. Throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war, and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession.  Gabor S. Boritt, \"'And the War Came'? Abraham Lincoln and the Question of Individual Responsibility,\" Why the Civil War Came ed by Boritt (1996), pp 3-30.. Throughout the election, Lincoln did not campaign or give speeches. This was handled by the state and county Republican organizations, who used the latest techniques to sustain party enthusiasm and thus obtain high turnout. There was little effort to convert non-Republicans, and there was virtually no campaigning in the South except for a few border cities such as St. Louis, Missouri, and Wheeling, Virginia; indeed, the party did not even run a slate in most of the South. In the North, there were thousands of Republican speakers, tons of campaign posters and leaflets, and thousands of newspaper editorials. These focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, making the most of his boyhood poverty, his pioneer background, his native genius, and his rise from obscurity. His nicknames, \"Honest Abe\" and \"the Rail-Splitter,\" were exploited to the full. The goal was to emphasize the superior power of \"free labor,\" whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts.  Thomas (1952) p 216; Reinhard H. Luthin, The First Lincoln Campaign (1944); Nevins vol 4;. On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, John C. Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and John Bell of the new Constitutional Union Party. He was the first Republican president, winning entirely on the strength of his support in the North: he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the South, and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other Southern states. Lincoln gained 1,865,908 votes (39.9% of the total), for 180 electoral votes; Douglas, 1,380,202 (29.5%) for 12 electoral votes; Breckenridge, 848,019 (18.1%) for 72 electoral votes; and Bell, 590,901 (12.5%) for 39 electoral votes. There were fusion tickets in some states, but even if his opponents had combined in every state, Lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election.. As Lincoln's election became more likely, secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the Union. South Carolina took the lead, followed by six other cotton-growing states in the deep South. The upper South (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to and rejected the secessionist appeal. They decided to stay in the Union, though they warned Lincoln that they would not support an invasion through their territory. The seven Confederate states seceded before Lincoln took office, declaring themselves to be a new nation, the Confederate States of America. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy.. President-elect Lincoln evaded possible assassins in Baltimore, and on February 23, 1861, arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C. At his inauguration on March 4, 1861, the German American Turners formed Lincoln's bodyguard; and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present, ready to protect the capital from Confederate invasion and local insurrection.. Photograph showing the March 4, 1861, inauguration of Abraham Lincoln in front of United States Capitol.. In his First Inaugural Address, Lincoln declared, \"I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments,\" arguing further that the purpose of the United States Constitution was \"to form a more perfect union\" than the Articles of Confederation which were explicitly perpetual, thus the Constitution too was perpetual. He asked rhetorically that even were the Constitution a simple contract, would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?. Also in his inaugural address, in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war, Lincoln supported the pending Corwin Amendment to the Constitution, which had already passed Congress. This amendment, which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it existed, was designed to appeal not to the Confederacy but to the critical border states. At the same time, Lincoln adamantly opposed the Crittenden Compromise, which would have permitted slavery in the territories. Despite support for the Crittenden compromise among some prominent Republicans (including William Seward), Lincoln denounced it saying that it \"would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people, tribe, and state owning a foot of land between here and Tierra del Fuego.\". By the time Lincoln took office, the Confederacy was an established fact, and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. No compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. Lincoln might have allowed the southern states to secede, and some Republicans recommended that. However, conservative Democratic nationalists, such as Jeremiah S. Black, Joseph Holt, and Edwin M. Stanton had taken control of Buchanan's cabinet around January 1, 1861, and refused to accept secession. Lincoln and nearly every Republican leader adopted this position by March 1861: the Union could not be dismantled. However, as a strict follower of the constitution, Lincoln refused to take any action against the South unless the Unionists themselves were attacked first. This finally happened in April 1861.. Historian Allan Nevins argues that Lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the Union, hold government property, and still avoid war. He \"temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis,\" overestimated the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South and border states, and misunderstood the conditional support of Unionists in the border states.  Allan Nevins, The Improvised War, 1861-1862 (1959) p 29. In April 1861, after Union troops at Fort Sumter were fired upon and forced to surrender, Lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and \"preserve the Union,\" which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. Virginia, which had repeatedly warned Lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state, responded by seceding, along with North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas.. The slave states of Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware did not secede, and Lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there, promising not to interfere with slavery. After the fighting started, he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas (especially in Maryland) and held in military prisons without trial. Over 18,000 were arrested, though none were executed. One, Clement Vallandigham, was exiled; but all of the remainder were released, usually after two or three months (see: Ex parte Merryman).. Lincoln met with his cabinet for the first reading of the Emancipation Proclamation draft on July 22, 1862. L-R: Edwin M. Stanton, Salmon P. Chase, Abraham Lincoln, Gideon Welles, Caleb B. Smith, William H. Seward, Montgomery Blair and Edward Bates. In July 1862, Congress moved to free the slaves by passing the Second Confiscation Act. The goal was to weaken the rebellion, which was led and controlled by slave owners. While it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery (the Thirteenth Amendment did that), the Act showed that Lincoln had the support of Congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. This new law was implemented with Lincoln's \"Emancipation Proclamation.\". Lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the United States. In 1861 – 1862, however, he made it clear that the North was fighting the war to preserve the Union, not to abolish slavery. Freeing the slaves became, in late 1862, a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. Abolitionists criticized Lincoln for his sluggishness over slavery per se, but on August 22, 1862, Lincoln explained:. The Emancipation Proclamation, announced on September 22 and put into effect on January 1, 1863, freed slaves in territories not under Union control. As Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all of them in Confederate hands (over three million) were freed. Lincoln later said: \"I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.\" The proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. Lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation. Lincoln addressed the issue of his consistency in an 1864 letter to Albert G. Hodges.  Letter to Albert G. Hodges, April 4, 1864. In September 1862, thirteen northern governors met in Altoona, Pennsylvania, at the Loyal War Governors' Conference to discuss the Proclamation and Union war effort. In the end, the state executives fully supported the president's Proclamation and also suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union's Army of the Potomac.  Images of America: Altoona, by Sr. Anne Francis Pulling, 2001, 10.. For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. As Frederick Douglass observed, Lincoln was, \"The first great man that I talked with in the United States freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself, of the difference of color.\" Life and Times of Frederick Douglass, by Frederick Douglass, 1895. After Union victories at Gettysburg, Vicksburg and Chattanooga in 1863, victory seemed at hand, and Lincoln promoted Ulysses S. Grant General-in-Chief ( March 12, 1864). When the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates, Lincoln supported Grant's strategy of wearing down Lee's Confederate army at the cost of heavy Union casualties. With an election looming, he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. At the Convention, the Republican Party selected Andrew Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. They ran on the new Union Party ticket uniting Republicans and War Democrats.. Lincoln, in top hat, with Allan Pinkerton and Gen. John Alexander McClernand at Antietam.. Nevertheless, Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Acknowledging this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would nonetheless defeat the Confederacy by an all-out military effort before turning over the White House: Mark Grimsley and Brooks D Simpson, eds. The Collapse of the Confederacy (2001) p 80. Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.. While the Democratic platform followed the Peace wing of the party and called the war a \"failure,\" their candidate, General George B. McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform.. Lincoln provided Grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to support Grant and win local support for the war effort. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September ended defeatist jitters; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln; the Union party was united and energized, and Lincoln was easily reelected in a landslide. He won all but two states, capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.. On March 4 1865, Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address, his favorite of all his speeches. At this time, a victory over the rebels was at hand, slavery was dead, and Lincoln was looking to the future.. “Running the ‘Machine’”. An 1864 cartoon featuring Lincoln, William Fessenden, Edwin Stanton, William Seward and Gideon Welles takes a swing at the Lincoln administration. The war was a source of constant frustration for the president, and occupied nearly all of his time. He had a contentious relationship with General McClellan, who became general-in-chief of all the Union armies in the wake of the embarrassing Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run and after the retirement of Winfield Scott in late 1861. Despite his inexperience in military affairs, Lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. His priorities were twofold: to ensure that Washington, D.C., was well defended; and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the Northern public and press. McClellan, a youthful West Point graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service, took a more cautious approach. He took several months to plan and execute his Peninsula Campaign, with the objective of capturing Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula between the James and York Rivers. McClellan's delay irritated Lincoln, as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend Washington, D.C. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops to defend the capital, a decision McClellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.. McClellan, a lifelong Democrat who was temperamentally conservative, was relieved as general-in-chief after releasing his Harrison's Landing Letter, where he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint John Pope, a Republican, as head of the new Army of Virginia. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack. But Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. In response to his failure, Pope was sent to Minnesota to fight the Sioux.. An 1864 Mathew Brady photo depicts President Lincoln reading a book with his youngest son, Tad. Panicked by Lee's invasion of Maryland, Lincoln restored McClellan to command of all forces around Washington in time for the Battle of Antietam (September 1862). The ensuing Union victory enabled Lincoln to release his Emancipation Proclamation, but he relieved McClellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed Republican Ambrose Burnside to head the Army of the Potomac. Burnside had promised to follow through on Lincoln's strategic vision for a strong offensive against Lee and Richmond. After Burnside was stunningly defeated at Fredericksburg, Joseph Hooker was given the command, despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders.  Joseph Hooker biography  Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville (May 1863), and relieved of command early in the subsequent Gettysburg Campaign replaced by George Meade.. After the Union victory at Gettysburg, Meade's failure to pursue Lee and months of inactivity for the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to bring in a western general, Ulysses S. Grant. Grant already had a solid string of victories in the Western Theater, including the battles of Vicksburg and Chattanooga. Responding to criticism of Grant, Lincoln was quoted as saying, \"I cannot spare this man. He fights.\" Grant waged his bloody Overland Campaign in 1864 with a strategy of a war of attrition, characterized by high Union losses at battles such as the Wilderness and Cold Harbor, but by proportionately higher Confederate losses. His invasion campaign eventually bottled Lee up in the Siege of Petersburg, so that Grant could take Richmond, and bring the war to a close in the spring of 1865.. Lincoln authorized Grant to target civilians and infrastructure, hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. This allowed Generals Sherman and Sheridan to destroy farms and towns in the Shenandoah Valley, Georgia, and South Carolina. The damage caused by Sherman's March to the Sea through Georgia totaled in excess of $100 million by Sherman's own estimate. See Hofstadter, Richard, The United States: The History of a Republic, Prentice-Hall, 1967, p. 446.. Lincoln had a star-crossed record as a military leader, possessing a keen understanding of strategic points (such as the Mississippi River and the fortress city of Vicksburg) and the importance of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing cities. He had, however, limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863, when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in Ulysses S. Grant. Only then could he insist on using African American troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.. Throughout the war, Lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. He spent hours at the War Department telegraph office, reading dispatches from his generals. He visited battle sites frequently, and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. During Jubal Anderson Early's raid on Washington, D.C. in 1864, Lincoln had to be told to duck to avoid being shot while observing the battle.. Reconstruction began during the war as Lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the Southern states and what to do with Confederate leaders and the freed slaves. Lincoln led the \"moderates\" regarding Reconstructionist policy, and was usually opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Thaddeus Stevens in the House and Charles Sumner and Benjamin Wade in the Senate (though he cooperated with these men on most other issues). Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind Union lines. His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.  /ref> Critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. Of special importance were Tennessee, where Lincoln appointed Andrew Johnson as governor, and Louisiana, where Lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. The Radicals thought this policy too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864. When Lincoln pocket-vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.  Donald (1995) ch. 20. On April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House in Virginia, and the war was effectively over. The other rebel armies surrendered soon after, and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare. Lincoln went to Richmond to make a public gesture of sitting at Jefferson Davis's own desk, symbolically saying to the nation that the President of the United States held authority over the entire land. He was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves, whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer's quote, \"I know I am free for I have seen the face of Father Abraham and have felt him.\" When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, Lincoln replied, \"Let 'em up easy.\"  Donald (1995) 576, 580,   \"President Lincoln Enters Richmond, 1865\" EyeWitness to History, www.eywitnesstohistory.com (2000).. One of the last photographs of Lincoln, likely taken between February and April 1865. Lincoln's powerful rhetoric defined the issues of the war for the nation, the world, and posterity. His extraordinary command of the English language was evidenced in the Gettysburg Address, a speech dedicating the cemetery at Gettysburg that he delivered on November 19, 1863. The speech defied Lincoln's own prediction that \"the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here.\" Lincoln's second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted. In these speeches, Lincoln articulated better than anyone else the rationale behind the Union cause.. In recent years, historians have stressed Lincoln's use of and redefinition of republican values. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln shifted emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism.  Jaffa (2000) p. 399  The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, rather than the Constitution's tolerance of slavers, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.\"  John Patrick Diggins, The Lost Soul of American Politics: Virtue, Self-interest, and the Foundations of Liberalism (1986) p. 307.  His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.  Foner (1970) p. 215 says, \"Lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism.\"  See also McPherson (1992) pp.61-64.  Nevertheless, in 1861 Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a \"republican form of government\" in every state. Jaffa (2000) p. 263  That duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in Reconstruction.. Lincoln's second inauguration on March 4, 1865. In the photo, Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth, can be seen in the crowd at the top and accomplices David Herold, Lewis Powell, George Atzerodt, John Surratt and Edmund Spangler in the bottom crowd. In his Gettysburg Address Lincoln redefined the American nation, arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776, \"conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\" He declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality, \"that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\" By emphasizing the centrality of the nation, he rebuffed the claims of state sovereignty. While some critics say Lincoln moved too far and too fast,  H.L. Mencken said \"It is difficult to imagine anything more untrue. The Union soldiers in the battle actually fought against self-determination; it was the Confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves.\" Mencken did not mention the right of self-determination rights for blacks.   they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked \"a new founding of the nation.\"  Wills (1992) p. 39.. During the Civil War, Lincoln appropriated powers no previous President had wielded: he used his war powers to proclaim a blockade, suspended the writ of habeas corpus, spent money without congressional authorization, and imprisoned 18,000 suspected Confederate sympathizers without trial. Nearly all of his actions, although vehemently denounced by the Copperheads, were subsequently upheld by Congress and the Courts.. Lincoln believed in the Whig theory of the presidency, which left Congress to write the laws while he signed them, vetoing only those bills that threatened his war powers. Thus, he signed the Homestead Act in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in 1869. Other important legislation involved economic matters, including the first income tax and higher tariffs. Also included was the creation of the system of national banks by the National Banking Acts of 1863, 1864, and 1865, which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system.  Congress created and Lincoln approved the Department of Agriculture in 1862, although that institution would not become a Cabinet-level department until 1889.. The Legal Tender Act of 1862 established the United States Note, the first paper currency in United States history.  This was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.. During the war, Lincoln's Treasury Department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied South—the most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.. In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope, to put down the \"Sioux Uprising\" in Minnesota. Presented with 303 death warrants for convicted Santee Dakota who had massacred innocent farmers, Lincoln affirmed 39 of these for execution (one was later reprieved).. The assassination of Abraham Lincoln. From left to right: Henry Rathbone, Clara Harris, Mary Todd Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth. Originally, John Wilkes Booth, a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland, had formulated a plan to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and determined to assassinate the president. Harrison, Lowell Hayes, Lincoln of Kentucky, University Press of Kentucky, 2000, pp. 3–4. ISBN 0813121566.  Learning that the President and First Lady, together with the Grants, would be attending Ford's Theatre, he laid his plans, assigning his co-conspirators to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward.. Without his main bodyguard Ward Hill Lamon, to whom he related his famous dream regarding his own assassination, Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14, 1865. As a lone bodyguard wandered, and Lincoln sat in his state box (Box 7) in the balcony, Booth crept up behind the President and waited for the funniest line of the play, hoping the laughter would muffle the noise of the gunshot. When the laughter began, Booth jumped into the box and aimed a single-shot, round-slug .44 caliber Henry Deringer at his head, firing at point-blank range. Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth but was cut by Booth's knife. Booth then leapt to the stage and shouted \"Sic semper tyrannis!\" (Latin: \"Thus always to tyrants\") and escaped, despite a broken leg suffered in the leap. George Alfred Townsend, The Life, Crime and Capture of John Wilkes Booth. New York: Dick & Fitzgerald, 1865. (LCCN  12002580.  A twelve-day manhunt ensued, in which Booth was chased by Federal agents (under the direction of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton). He was eventually cornered in a Virginia barn house  and shot, dying of his wounds soon after.. An army surgeon, Doctor Charles Leale, initially assessed Lincoln's wound as mortal. The President was taken across the street from the theater to the Petersen House, where he lay in a coma for nine hours before he died. Several physicians attended Lincoln, including U.S. Army Surgeon General Joseph K. Barnes of the Army Medical Museum. Using a probe, Barnes located some fragments of Lincoln's skull and the ball lodged 6 inches (15 cm) inside his brain. Lincoln never regained consciousness and was officially pronounced dead at 7:22:10 a.m. April 15, 1865 at the age of 56. There is some disagreement among historians as to Stanton's words after Lincoln died. All agree that he began \"Now he belongs to the...\" with some stating he said \"ages\" while others believe he said \"angels.\"  After Lincoln's body was returned to the White House, his body was prepared for his lying in repose in the East Room. He was the first president to lie in state.. The Army Medical Museum, now named the National Museum of Health and Medicine, has retained in its collection several artifacts relating to the assassination. Currently on display are the bullet that was fired from the Derringer pistol, the probe used by Barnes, pieces of Lincoln's skull and hair, and the surgeon's cuff stained with Lincoln's blood.. Lincoln's funeral train carried his remains, as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son William, 1,654 miles (2,661 km) to Illinois . Lincoln's body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to Illinois.  While much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the United States, Copperheads celebrated the death of a man they considered an unconstitutional tyrant. The Lincoln Tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, is 177 feet (54 m) tall and, by 1874, was surmounted with several bronze statues of Lincoln. To prevent repeated attempts to steal Lincoln's body and hold it for ransom, Robert Todd Lincoln had Lincoln exhumed and reinterred in concrete several feet thick in 1901.. With over 120 photographs taken of him, Lincoln was the most photographed man in the United States up to the time he was assassinated.. Lincoln was known for appointing political rivals to high positions in his cabinet to keep in line all factions of his party — and to let them battle each other and not combine against Lincoln. Historians agree that except for Simon Cameron, it was a highly effective group.. Abraham Lincoln's official White House portrait. Lincoln appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States:. In March 1860 in a speech in New Haven, Connecticut, Lincoln said, with respect to slavery, “Whenever this question shall be settled, it must be settled on some philosophical basis. No policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained.\" The philosophical basis for Lincoln’s beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that Lincoln be examined \"seriously as a man of ideas.\" Lincoln was a strong supporter of the American Whig version of liberal capitalism who, more than most politicians of the time, was able to express his ideas within the context of Nineteenth Century religious beliefs. Guelzo pg. 18-19. There were few people who strongly or directly influenced Lincoln’s moral and intellectual development and perspectives. There was no teacher, mentor, church leader, community leader, or peer that Lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. Lacking a formal education, Lincoln’s personal philosophy was shaped by \"an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning.\" It was Lincoln’s reading, rather than his relationships, that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs. Guelzo pg. 20. Miller pg. 57-59  Lincoln’s reading and study of the Bible was an integral part of his intellectual roots.. Lincoln did, even as a boy, largely reject organized religion, but the Calvinistic \"doctrine of necessity\" would remain a factor throughout his life. In 1846 Lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as \"that the human mind is impelled to action, or held in rest by some power, over which the mind itself has no control.\" Donald pg. 15. The quote came from a letter to the public in which Lincoln was denying charges by a political opponent that he was a “religious scoffer.”  In April 1864, in justifying his actions in regard to Emancipation, Lincoln wrote, \"I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of three years struggle the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. God alone can claim it.\" Donald pg. 514. As Lincoln matured, and especially during his term as president, the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. On a personal level, the death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace. Wilson pg. 251-254  After Willie’s death, in the summer or early fall of 1862, Lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary:. Lincoln’s religious skepticism was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the Lockean Enlightenment and classical liberalism, especially economic liberalism. Guelzo pg. 20  Consistent with the common practice of the Whig party, Lincoln would often use the Declaration of Independence as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies. Guelzo pg.194  In a February 22, 1861 speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia Lincoln said,. He found in the Declaration justification for Whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the nativist platform of the Know Nothings. In claiming that all men were created free, Lincoln and the Whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement, expanded education, territory to grow, and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population. Guelzo pg.194-195. It was the Declaration of Independence, rather than the Bible, that Lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. He saw the Declaration as more than a political document. To him, as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders, it was, foremost, a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation. Miller pg. 297. While Lincoln is usually portrayed bearded, he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year-old Grace Bedell. Lincoln's death made the President a martyr to many. Repeated polls of historians have ranked Lincoln as among the greatest presidents in U.S. history, often appearing in the first position. Among contemporary admirers, Lincoln is usually seen as personifying classical values of honesty and integrity, as well as respect for individual and minority rights, and human freedom in general.. Many American organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image, with interests ranging from the gay rights-supporting Log Cabin Republicans to the insurance corporation Lincoln National Corporation. The Lincoln automobile is also named after him. The ballistic missile submarine Abraham Lincoln (SSBN-602) and the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) were named in his honor. Also, the Liberty ship, SS Nancy Hanks was named to honor his mother. During the Spanish Civil War the American faction of the International Brigades named themselves the Abraham Lincoln Brigade after Lincoln.. Lincoln has been memorialized in many city names, notably the capital of Nebraska. Lincoln, Illinois, is the only city to be named for Abraham Lincoln before he became President. Lincoln's name and image appear in numerous places. These include the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., the U.S. Lincoln $5 bill and the Lincoln cent, Lincoln's sculpture on the Mount Rushmore, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois. In addition, New Salem, Illinois (a reconstruction of Lincoln's early adult hometown), Ford's Theatre, and Petersen House (where he died) are all preserved as museums. The Lincoln Shrine in Redlands, California, is located behind the A.K. Smiley Public Library. The state nickname for Illinois is Land of Lincoln.. Counties in 19 U.S. states (Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) are named after Lincoln.. Abraham Lincoln's birthday, February 12, was formerly a national holiday, now commemorated as Presidents' Day. However, it is still observed in Illinois and many other states as a separate legal holiday, Lincoln's Birthday. A dozen states have legal holidays celebrating the third Monday in February as 'Presidents' Day' as a combination Washington-Lincoln Day.. To commemorate his upcoming 200th birthday in February 2009, Congress established the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission (ALBC) in 2000. Dedicated to renewing American appreciation of Lincoln’s legacy, the 15-member commission is made up of lawmakers and scholars and also features an adivsory board of over 130 various Lincoln historians and enthusiasts. Located at Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., the ALBC is the organizing force behind numerous tributes, programs and cultural events highlighting a two-year celebration scheduled to begin in February 2008 at Lincoln’s birthplace:  Hodgenville, Kentucky.. Lincoln's birthplace and family home are national historic memorials: the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site in Hodgenville, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois.

              "1     Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the sixteenth President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1861 until his assassination. As an outspoken opponent of the expansion of slavery in the United States, \"[I]n his short autobiography written for the 1860 presidential campaign, Lincoln would describe his protest in the Illinois legislature as one that 'briefly defined his position on the slavery question, and so far as it goes, it was then the same that it is now.\" This was in reference to the anti-expansion sentiments he had then expressed. Doris Kearns Goodwin, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln (2005) p. 91.  Holzer pg. 232.  Writing of the Cooper Union  speech, Holzer notes, \"Cooper Union proved a unique confluence of political culture, rhetorical opportunity, technological innovation, and human genius, and it brought Abraham Lincoln to the center stage of American politics at precisely the right time and place, and with precisely the right message: that slavery was wrong, and ought to be confined to the areas where it already existed, and placed on the 'course of ultimate extinction... .'\"  Lincoln won the Republican Party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year. During his term, he helped preserve the United States by leading the defeat of the secessionist Confederate States of America in the American Civil War. He introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery, issuing his Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1865.. Lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including Ulysses S. Grant. Historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the Republican Party well, bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. Lincoln successfully defused a war scare with the United Kingdom in 1861. Under his leadership, the Union took control of the border slave states at the start of the war. Additionally, he managed his own reelection in the 1864 presidential election.. Opponents of the war (also known as \"Copperheads\") criticized him for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans, an abolitionist faction of the Republican Party, criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. Even with these problems, Lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches; his Gettysburg Address is but one example of this. At the close of the war, Lincoln held a moderate view of Reconstruction, seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. His assassination in 1865 was the first presidential assassination in U.S. history and made him a martyr for the ideal of national unity.. Scholars now rank Lincoln among the top three U.S. Presidents, with the majority of those surveyed placing him first. He is noted for his lasting influence on U.S. politics, including a redefinition of republicanism.  As Diggins explains, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.\" John Patrick Diggins, The Lost Soul of American Politics: Virtue, Self-interest, and the Foundations of Liberalism (1986) p. 307. Foner (1970) p. 215 noted that, \"Lincoln stressed the moral basis of Republicanism.\" Jaffa (2000) p. 399, stresses Lincoln's emphasis on the Declaration of Independence as what Lincoln called the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism. See also McPherson (1992) pp.61-64.. Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, to Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks, two uneducated farmers. Lincoln was born in a one-room log cabin on the   Sinking Spring Farm, in southeast Hardin County, Kentucky (now part of LaRue County). This area was at the time considered the \"frontier.\" The name \"Abraham\" was chosen to commemorate his grandfather, who was killed in an American Indian raid in 1786. Donald (1995) p 21  His elder sister, Sarah Lincoln, was born in 1807; a younger brother, Thomas Jr, died in infancy. It is sometimes debated whether Lincoln had Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of the connective tissue characterized by long limbs and great physical stature.  Marfan syndrome: Introduction Aug 1, 2006. Symbolic log cabin at Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site.. For some time, Thomas Lincoln was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the Kentucky back country. He had purchased the Sinking Spring Farm in December of 1808 for $200 cash and assumption of a debt.  The farm site is now preserved as part of Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site.  The family belonged to a Baptist church that had seceded from a larger church over the issue of slavery. Though Lincoln was exposed to his parents' anti-slavery sentiment from a very young age, he never joined their church, or any other church for that matter.  As a youth he had little use for religion. Life of Abraham Lincoln, Colonel Ward H. Lamon, 1872 - portions reprinted in  Chapter VIII: Abraham Lincoln, Deist, and Admirer of Thomas Paine, From the book Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents by Franklin Steiner (1936). Lincoln was just seven years old when, in 1816, the family was forced to make a new start in Perry County (now in Spencer County), Indiana. He later noted that this move was \"partly on account of slavery,\" and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in Kentucky: Unlike land in the Northwest Territory, Kentucky never had a proper U.S. survey, and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property. Lincoln was only nine when his mother, then thirty-four years old, died of milk sickness. Soon afterwards, his father remarried  to Sarah Bush Johnston. Sarah Lincoln raised young Lincoln like one of her own children. Years later she compared Lincoln to her own son, saying \"Both were good boys, but I must say — both now being dead that Abe was the best boy I ever saw or ever expect to see.\" Lincoln was affectionate toward his stepmother, whom he would call \"Mother\" for the rest of his life, but he was distant from his father.  Donald, (1995) pp. 28, 152.. In 1830, after more economic and land-title difficulties in Indiana, the family settled on public land  /ref> in Macon County, Illinois. Some scholars believe that it was his father's repeated land-title difficulties and ensuing financial hardships that led young Lincoln to study law.  The following winter was desolate and especially brutal, and the family considered moving back to Indiana. The following year, when his father relocated the family to a new homestead in Coles County, Illinois, twenty-two-year-old Lincoln struck out on his own, canoeing down the Sangamon River to the village of New Salem in Sangamon County. Later that year, hired by New Salem businessman Denton Offutt and accompanied by friends, he took goods from New Salem to New Orleans via flatboat on the Sangamon, Illinois and Mississippi rivers. While in New Orleans, he may have witnessed a slave auction, though as a frequent visitor to Kentucky, he would have had several earlier opportunities to witness  similar sales.  Donald, (1995) ch. 2.. Lincoln's formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling. Largely self-educated, he read every book he could get his hands on, once walking.  just to borrow one  While his favorite book was The Life of George Washington, Lincoln mastered the Bible, Shakespeare, and English and American history, and developed a plain writing style that puzzled audiences more used to grandiose rhetoric. He was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an ax; some rails he had allegedly split in his youth were exhibited at the 1860 Republican National Convention, as the party celebrated the poor-boy-made-good theme. Lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals, even for food. Though he was unusually tall at  , 4 inches and strong, Lincoln spent so much time reading that some neighbors suspected he must be doing it to avoid strenuous manual labor.. Young Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln began his political career in 1832, at age 23, with an unsuccessful campaign for the Illinois General Assembly, as a member of the Whig Party.  He ran eighth in a field of 13 candidates.  The centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the Sangamon River. He believed that this would attract steamboat traffic, which would allow the sparsely populated, poorer areas along the river to flourish.. He was elected captain of an Illinois militia company drawn from New Salem during the Black Hawk War, and later wrote that he had not had \"any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction.\"  Thomas (1952) 32-34; Basler (1946) p. 551   Though he never saw combat, Lincoln did assist in burying the dead from the Battle of Stillman's Run the day after Major Isaiah Stillman's troops fled the field of battle.  Abraham Lincoln Online Retrieved on March 11, 2007. For several months, Lincoln ran a small store in New Salem, selling tea, coffee, sugar, salt, blue calico, brown muslin, straw hats and whiskey.  Beveridge (1928) 1:127-8  Later, he found work as village postmaster and as a surveyor.. In 1834, he won election to the state legislature, and after coming across the Commentaries on the Laws of England, began to teach himself law. Admitted to the bar in 1837, he moved to Springfield, Illinois, that same year and began to practice law with John T. Stuart. With a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and in his closing arguments, Lincoln became one of the most respected and successful lawyers in Illinois and grew steadily more prosperous.. He served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a representative from Sangamon County, and became a leader of the Illinois Whig party. In 1837, he made his first protest against slavery in the Illinois House, stating that the institution was \"founded on both injustice and bad policy.\"  Protest in Illinois Legislature on Slavery, p.75, March 3, 1837  It was also in this same year that Lincoln met Joshua Fry Speed, who would become his most intimate friend.. Lincoln wrote a series of anonymous letters, published in 1842 in the Sangamon Journal, mocking State Auditor and prominent Democrat James Shields. Shields would later become a U.S. senator, but when he learned that it was Lincoln who had been writing the barbs, he challenged him to a duel. As Shields was the challenger, Lincoln was granted the right to choose the weapon and specified \"Cavalry broad swords of the largest size.\" Much taller and with long arms, this gave him an overwhelming advantage over his opponent; however, the duel was called off at the last minute. Beveridge (1928) 1:349. Lincoln had been practicing with the broad sword.  Two years later, Lincoln entered law practice with William Herndon, a fellow Whig. In 1854, both men joined the fledgling Republican Party. Following Lincoln's death, Herndon began collecting stories about Lincoln and published them in Herndon's Lincoln.. The first photograph ever taken of Mary Lincoln, a daguerreotype by Shepherd in 1846.. On November 4 1842 Lincoln married Mary Todd, daughter of a prominent slave-owning family from Kentucky. The couple had four sons. Robert Todd Lincoln was born in Springfield, Illinois on 1 August, 1843. Their only child to survive into adulthood, young Robert attended Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard College. Robert died on July 26, 1926, in Manchester, Vermont.. The other Lincoln children were born in Springfield, Illinois, and died either during childhood or their teen years. Edward Baker Lincoln was born on March 10, 1846, and died on 1 February, 1850, also in Springfield. William Wallace Lincoln was born on December 21, 1850, and died on February 20, 1862 in Washington, D.C., during Pres. Lincoln's first term. Thomas \"Tad\" Lincoln was born on 4 April, 1853, and died on July 16, 1871 in Chicago.. Four of his wife's brothers fought for the Confederacy, with one wounded and another killed in action. Lieutenant David H. Todd, a half-brother of Mary Todd Lincoln, served as commandant of the Libby Prison camp during the war.. The first photograph ever taken of Abraham Lincoln, a daguerreotype taken by Shepherd in 1846.. A Whig and an admirer of party leader Henry Clay,  Lincoln was elected to a term in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1846. As a freshman House member, he was not a particularly powerful or influential figure. He spoke out against the Mexican-American War, which he attributed to President Polk's desire for \"military glory — that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood.\" He also challenged the President's claims regarding the Texas boundary and offered Spot Resolutions demanding to know on what \"spot\" on US soil that blood was first spilt.  Congressional Globe, 30th Session (1848) pp.93-95  In January of 1848, he was among the 82 Whigs who defeated 81 Democrats in a procedural vote on an amendment to send a routine resolution back to committee with instructions to add the words \"a war unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the President of the United States.\" The amendment passed, but the bill never reemerged from committee and was never finally voted upon.  House Journal, 30th Session (1848) pp.183-184. Lincoln later damaged his political reputation with a speech in which he declared, \"God of Heaven has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent, and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men, women, and children, and lay waste and pillage the land of the just.\" Two weeks later, President Polk sent a peace treaty to Congress. While no one in Washington paid any attention to Lincoln, the Democrats orchestrated angry outbursts from across his district, where the war was popular and many had volunteered. In Morgan County, resolutions were adopted in fervent support of the war and in wrathful denunciation of the \"treasonable assaults of guerrillas at home; party demagogues; slanderers of the President; defenders of the butchery at the Alamo; traducers of the heroism at San Jacinto.\"  Abe Lincoln resource page. Warned by his law partner, William Herndon, that the damage was mounting and irreparable, Lincoln decided not to run for reelection. In fact, in 1848 he campaigned vigorously for Zachary Taylor, the successful general whose atrocities he had denounced in January. Regardless, his statements were not easily forgotten, and would haunt him during the Civil War. These statements were also held against him when he applied for a position in the new Taylor administration. Instead, Taylor's people offered Lincoln various positions in the remote Oregon Territory, primarily the governorship. Acceptance of this offer would have ended his career in the rapidly growing state of Illinois, so Lincoln declined the position. Returning to Springfield, Lincoln gave up politics for several years and turned his energies to his law practice. During this time, he made many trips on horseback between various counties' courthouses. Beveridge, (1928) 1: 428-33; Donald (1995) p. 140-43.. In the 1920s historical markers were placed at the county lines along the route Lincoln traveled in the eight judicial district. This example is on the border of Piatt and DeWitt counties. By the mid-1850s, Lincoln's caseload focused largely on the competing transportation interests of river barges and railroads. In one prominent 1851 case, he represented the Alton & Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with a shareholder, James A. Barret. Barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to the railroad on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. Lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest, that the newer route proposed by Alton & Sangamon was superior and less expensive, and that accordingly, the corporation had a right to sue Barret for his delinquent payment. He won this case, and the decision by the Illinois Supreme Court was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the United States. Donald, (1995) ch. 6.. Possibly the most notable criminal trial of Lincoln's career as a lawyer came in 1858, when he defended William \"Duff\" Armstrong, who has been charged with murder. The case became famous for Lincoln's use of judicial notice--a rare tactic at that time--to show that an eyewitness had lied on the stand. After the witness testified to having seen the crime by moonlight, Lincoln produced a Farmers' Almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle that it could not have provided enough illumination to see anything clearly. Based almost entirely on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted. Donald (1995), 150-51. Lincoln was involved in more than 5,100 cases in Illinois alone during his 23-year legal career. Though many of these cases involved little more than filing a writ, others were more substantial and quite involved. Lincoln and his partners appeared before the Illinois State Supreme Court more than 400 times. During one trial, Lincoln's voir dire included a question to prospective jurors as to whether they were acquainted with counsel for the other side. When a few of them turned out to know the other lawyer, the judge interrupted, saying, \"Mr. Lincoln, you are wasting the time of the court. The fact that a prospective juror knows your opponent does not disqualify him.\". \"No, Your Honor, I understand that,\" Lincoln answered. \"I'm afraid that some of them might not know him, which would place me at a disadvantage.\". Lincoln returned to politics in response to the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854), which expressly repealed the limits on slavery's extent as determined by the Missouri Compromise (1820). Illinois Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, the most powerful man in the Senate, proposed popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse, and incorporated it into the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory, rather than have such a decision imposed on them by Congress.  Donald, (1995) ch. 7.. In a speech against the act, on October 16 1854, delivered in Peoria, Lincoln first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day:. Drawing on remnants of the old Whig, Free Soil, Liberty and Democratic parties, he was instrumental in forming the new Republican Party. In a stirring campaign, the Republicans carried Illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. Lincoln was the obvious choice, but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an ex-Democrat Lyman Trumbull.. In 1857-58, Douglas broke with President Buchanan, leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state. Accepting the Republican nomination for Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered his famous speech: \"'A house divided against itself cannot stand.'(Mark 3:25) I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.\"  A House Divided Against Itself Cannot Stand, June 1858  The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the north.. The 1858 campaign featured the Lincoln-Douglas debates, a nationally famous contest on slavery. Lincoln warned that the \"Slave Power\" was threatening the values of republicanism, while Douglas emphasized the supremacy of democracy, as set forth in his Freeport Doctrine, which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not. Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature reelected Douglas to the Senate. Nevertheless, Lincoln's eloquence transformed him into a national political star.. During the debates of 1858, the issue of race was often discussed. During a time period when few believed in racial egalitarianism, Stephen Douglas informed the crowds, \"If you desire Negro citizenship… if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves… then support Mr. Lincoln and the Black Republican party, who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro.\"  First Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Ottawa, Illinois, August 21, 1858  Lincoln countered that he was \"not in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races.\"  Fourth Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Charleston, Illinois, September 18, 1858  His opposition to slavery was opposition to the Slave Power, though this would change during the course of the Civil War. Donald, (1995) ch. 8.. On May 9-10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur. At this convention, Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.. \"The Rail Candidate,\" Lincoln's 1860 candidacy is held up by slavery issue (slave on left) and party organization (New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley on right). Photo of Lincoln taken February 27, 1860 in New York City by Mathew Brady, the day of his famous Cooper Union speech.. Entering the presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog, Lincoln was eventually chosen as the Republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. His expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase. His \"Western\" origins also appealed to the newer states: other contenders, especially those with more governmental experience, had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states, while Lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the West. Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government. Yet despite his Southern connections (his in-laws owned slaves), Lincoln misunderstood the depth of the revolution underway in the South and the emergence of Southern nationalism. Throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war, and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession.  Gabor S. Boritt, \"'And the War Came'? Abraham Lincoln and the Question of Individual Responsibility,\" Why the Civil War Came ed by Boritt (1996), pp 3-30.. Throughout the election, Lincoln did not campaign or give speeches. This was handled by the state and county Republican organizations, who used the latest techniques to sustain party enthusiasm and thus obtain high turnout. There was little effort to convert non-Republicans, and there was virtually no campaigning in the South except for a few border cities such as St. Louis, Missouri, and Wheeling, Virginia; indeed, the party did not even run a slate in most of the South. In the North, there were thousands of Republican speakers, tons of campaign posters and leaflets, and thousands of newspaper editorials. These focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, making the most of his boyhood poverty, his pioneer background, his native genius, and his rise from obscurity. His nicknames, \"Honest Abe\" and \"the Rail-Splitter,\" were exploited to the full. The goal was to emphasize the superior power of \"free labor,\" whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts.  Thomas (1952) p 216; Reinhard H. Luthin, The First Lincoln Campaign (1944); Nevins vol 4;. On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, John C. Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and John Bell of the new Constitutional Union Party. He was the first Republican president, winning entirely on the strength of his support in the North: he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the South, and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other Southern states. Lincoln gained 1,865,908 votes (39.9% of the total), for 180 electoral votes; Douglas, 1,380,202 (29.5%) for 12 electoral votes; Breckenridge, 848,019 (18.1%) for 72 electoral votes; and Bell, 590,901 (12.5%) for 39 electoral votes. There were fusion tickets in some states, but even if his opponents had combined in every state, Lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election.. As Lincoln's election became more likely, secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the Union. South Carolina took the lead, followed by six other cotton-growing states in the deep South. The upper South (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to and rejected the secessionist appeal. They decided to stay in the Union, though they warned Lincoln that they would not support an invasion through their territory. The seven Confederate states seceded before Lincoln took office, declaring themselves to be a new nation, the Confederate States of America. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy.. President-elect Lincoln evaded possible assassins in Baltimore, and on February 23, 1861, arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C. At his inauguration on March 4, 1861, the German American Turners formed Lincoln's bodyguard; and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present, ready to protect the capital from Confederate invasion and local insurrection.. Photograph showing the March 4, 1861, inauguration of Abraham Lincoln in front of United States Capitol.. In his First Inaugural Address, Lincoln declared, \"I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments,\" arguing further that the purpose of the United States Constitution was \"to form a more perfect union\" than the Articles of Confederation which were explicitly perpetual, thus the Constitution too was perpetual. He asked rhetorically that even were the Constitution a simple contract, would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?. Also in his inaugural address, in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war, Lincoln supported the pending Corwin Amendment to the Constitution, which had already passed Congress. This amendment, which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it existed, was designed to appeal not to the Confederacy but to the critical border states. At the same time, Lincoln adamantly opposed the Crittenden Compromise, which would have permitted slavery in the territories. Despite support for the Crittenden compromise among some prominent Republicans (including William Seward), Lincoln denounced it saying that it \"would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people, tribe, and state owning a foot of land between here and Tierra del Fuego.\". By the time Lincoln took office, the Confederacy was an established fact, and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. No compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. Lincoln might have allowed the southern states to secede, and some Republicans recommended that. However, conservative Democratic nationalists, such as Jeremiah S. Black, Joseph Holt, and Edwin M. Stanton had taken control of Buchanan's cabinet around January 1, 1861, and refused to accept secession. Lincoln and nearly every Republican leader adopted this position by March 1861: the Union could not be dismantled. However, as a strict follower of the constitution, Lincoln refused to take any action against the South unless the Unionists themselves were attacked first. This finally happened in April 1861.. Historian Allan Nevins argues that Lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the Union, hold government property, and still avoid war. He \"temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis,\" overestimated the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South and border states, and misunderstood the conditional support of Unionists in the border states.  Allan Nevins, The Improvised War, 1861-1862 (1959) p 29. In April 1861, after Union troops at Fort Sumter were fired upon and forced to surrender, Lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and \"preserve the Union,\" which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. Virginia, which had repeatedly warned Lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state, responded by seceding, along with North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas.. The slave states of Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware did not secede, and Lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there, promising not to interfere with slavery. After the fighting started, he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas (especially in Maryland) and held in military prisons without trial. Over 18,000 were arrested, though none were executed. One, Clement Vallandigham, was exiled; but all of the remainder were released, usually after two or three months (see: Ex parte Merryman).. Lincoln met with his cabinet for the first reading of the Emancipation Proclamation draft on July 22, 1862. L-R: Edwin M. Stanton, Salmon P. Chase, Abraham Lincoln, Gideon Welles, Caleb B. Smith, William H. Seward, Montgomery Blair and Edward Bates. In July 1862, Congress moved to free the slaves by passing the Second Confiscation Act. The goal was to weaken the rebellion, which was led and controlled by slave owners. While it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery (the Thirteenth Amendment did that), the Act showed that Lincoln had the support of Congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. This new law was implemented with Lincoln's \"Emancipation Proclamation.\". Lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the United States. In 1861 – 1862, however, he made it clear that the North was fighting the war to preserve the Union, not to abolish slavery. Freeing the slaves became, in late 1862, a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. Abolitionists criticized Lincoln for his sluggishness over slavery per se, but on August 22, 1862, Lincoln explained:. The Emancipation Proclamation, announced on September 22 and put into effect on January 1, 1863, freed slaves in territories not under Union control. As Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all of them in Confederate hands (over three million) were freed. Lincoln later said: \"I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.\" The proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. Lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation. Lincoln addressed the issue of his consistency in an 1864 letter to Albert G. Hodges.  Letter to Albert G. Hodges, April 4, 1864. In September 1862, thirteen northern governors met in Altoona, Pennsylvania, at the Loyal War Governors' Conference to discuss the Proclamation and Union war effort. In the end, the state executives fully supported the president's Proclamation and also suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union's Army of the Potomac.  Images of America: Altoona, by Sr. Anne Francis Pulling, 2001, 10.. For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. As Frederick Douglass observed, Lincoln was, \"The first great man that I talked with in the United States freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself, of the difference of color.\" Life and Times of Frederick Douglass, by Frederick Douglass, 1895. After Union victories at Gettysburg, Vicksburg and Chattanooga in 1863, victory seemed at hand, and Lincoln promoted Ulysses S. Grant General-in-Chief ( March 12, 1864). When the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates, Lincoln supported Grant's strategy of wearing down Lee's Confederate army at the cost of heavy Union casualties. With an election looming, he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. At the Convention, the Republican Party selected Andrew Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. They ran on the new Union Party ticket uniting Republicans and War Democrats.. Lincoln, in top hat, with Allan Pinkerton and Gen. John Alexander McClernand at Antietam.. Nevertheless, Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Acknowledging this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would nonetheless defeat the Confederacy by an all-out military effort before turning over the White House: Mark Grimsley and Brooks D Simpson, eds. The Collapse of the Confederacy (2001) p 80. Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.. While the Democratic platform followed the Peace wing of the party and called the war a \"failure,\" their candidate, General George B. McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform.. Lincoln provided Grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to support Grant and win local support for the war effort. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September ended defeatist jitters; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln; the Union party was united and energized, and Lincoln was easily reelected in a landslide. He won all but two states, capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.. On March 4 1865, Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address, his favorite of all his speeches. At this time, a victory over the rebels was at hand, slavery was dead, and Lincoln was looking to the future.. “Running the ‘Machine’”. An 1864 cartoon featuring Lincoln, William Fessenden, Edwin Stanton, William Seward and Gideon Welles takes a swing at the Lincoln administration. The war was a source of constant frustration for the president, and occupied nearly all of his time. He had a contentious relationship with General McClellan, who became general-in-chief of all the Union armies in the wake of the embarrassing Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run and after the retirement of Winfield Scott in late 1861. Despite his inexperience in military affairs, Lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. His priorities were twofold: to ensure that Washington, D.C., was well defended; and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the Northern public and press. McClellan, a youthful West Point graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service, took a more cautious approach. He took several months to plan and execute his Peninsula Campaign, with the objective of capturing Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula between the James and York Rivers. McClellan's delay irritated Lincoln, as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend Washington, D.C. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops to defend the capital, a decision McClellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.. McClellan, a lifelong Democrat who was temperamentally conservative, was relieved as general-in-chief after releasing his Harrison's Landing Letter, where he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint John Pope, a Republican, as head of the new Army of Virginia. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack. But Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. In response to his failure, Pope was sent to Minnesota to fight the Sioux.. An 1864 Mathew Brady photo depicts President Lincoln reading a book with his youngest son, Tad. Panicked by Lee's invasion of Maryland, Lincoln restored McClellan to command of all forces around Washington in time for the Battle of Antietam (September 1862). The ensuing Union victory enabled Lincoln to release his Emancipation Proclamation, but he relieved McClellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed Republican Ambrose Burnside to head the Army of the Potomac. Burnside had promised to follow through on Lincoln's strategic vision for a strong offensive against Lee and Richmond. After Burnside was stunningly defeated at Fredericksburg, Joseph Hooker was given the command, despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders.  Joseph Hooker biography  Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville (May 1863), and relieved of command early in the subsequent Gettysburg Campaign replaced by George Meade.. After the Union victory at Gettysburg, Meade's failure to pursue Lee and months of inactivity for the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to bring in a western general, Ulysses S. Grant. Grant already had a solid string of victories in the Western Theater, including the battles of Vicksburg and Chattanooga. Responding to criticism of Grant, Lincoln was quoted as saying, \"I cannot spare this man. He fights.\" Grant waged his bloody Overland Campaign in 1864 with a strategy of a war of attrition, characterized by high Union losses at battles such as the Wilderness and Cold Harbor, but by proportionately higher Confederate losses. His invasion campaign eventually bottled Lee up in the Siege of Petersburg, so that Grant could take Richmond, and bring the war to a close in the spring of 1865.. Lincoln authorized Grant to target civilians and infrastructure, hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. This allowed Generals Sherman and Sheridan to destroy farms and towns in the Shenandoah Valley, Georgia, and South Carolina. The damage caused by Sherman's March to the Sea through Georgia totaled in excess of $100 million by Sherman's own estimate. See Hofstadter, Richard, The United States: The History of a Republic, Prentice-Hall, 1967, p. 446.. Lincoln had a star-crossed record as a military leader, possessing a keen understanding of strategic points (such as the Mississippi River and the fortress city of Vicksburg) and the importance of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing cities. He had, however, limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863, when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in Ulysses S. Grant. Only then could he insist on using African American troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.. Throughout the war, Lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. He spent hours at the War Department telegraph office, reading dispatches from his generals. He visited battle sites frequently, and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. During Jubal Anderson Early's raid on Washington, D.C. in 1864, Lincoln had to be told to duck to avoid being shot while observing the battle.. Reconstruction began during the war as Lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the Southern states and what to do with Confederate leaders and the freed slaves. Lincoln led the \"moderates\" regarding Reconstructionist policy, and was usually opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Thaddeus Stevens in the House and Charles Sumner and Benjamin Wade in the Senate (though he cooperated with these men on most other issues). Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind Union lines. His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.  /ref> Critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. Of special importance were Tennessee, where Lincoln appointed Andrew Johnson as governor, and Louisiana, where Lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. The Radicals thought this policy too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864. When Lincoln pocket-vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.  Donald (1995) ch. 20. On April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House in Virginia, and the war was effectively over. The other rebel armies surrendered soon after, and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare. Lincoln went to Richmond to make a public gesture of sitting at Jefferson Davis's own desk, symbolically saying to the nation that the President of the United States held authority over the entire land. He was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves, whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer's quote, \"I know I am free for I have seen the face of Father Abraham and have felt him.\" When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, Lincoln replied, \"Let 'em up easy.\"  Donald (1995) 576, 580,   \"President Lincoln Enters Richmond, 1865\" EyeWitness to History, www.eywitnesstohistory.com (2000).. One of the last photographs of Lincoln, likely taken between February and April 1865. Lincoln's powerful rhetoric defined the issues of the war for the nation, the world, and posterity. His extraordinary command of the English language was evidenced in the Gettysburg Address, a speech dedicating the cemetery at Gettysburg that he delivered on November 19, 1863. The speech defied Lincoln's own prediction that \"the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here.\" Lincoln's second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted. In these speeches, Lincoln articulated better than anyone else the rationale behind the Union cause.. In recent years, historians have stressed Lincoln's use of and redefinition of republican values. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln shifted emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism.  Jaffa (2000) p. 399  The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, rather than the Constitution's tolerance of slavers, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.\"  John Patrick Diggins, The Lost Soul of American Politics: Virtue, Self-interest, and the Foundations of Liberalism (1986) p. 307.  His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.  Foner (1970) p. 215 says, \"Lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism.\"  See also McPherson (1992) pp.61-64.  Nevertheless, in 1861 Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a \"republican form of government\" in every state. Jaffa (2000) p. 263  That duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in Reconstruction.. Lincoln's second inauguration on March 4, 1865. In the photo, Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth, can be seen in the crowd at the top and accomplices David Herold, Lewis Powell, George Atzerodt, John Surratt and Edmund Spangler in the bottom crowd. In his Gettysburg Address Lincoln redefined the American nation, arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776, \"conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\" He declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality, \"that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\" By emphasizing the centrality of the nation, he rebuffed the claims of state sovereignty. While some critics say Lincoln moved too far and too fast,  H.L. Mencken said \"It is difficult to imagine anything more untrue. The Union soldiers in the battle actually fought against self-determination; it was the Confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves.\" Mencken did not mention the right of self-determination rights for blacks.   they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked \"a new founding of the nation.\"  Wills (1992) p. 39.. During the Civil War, Lincoln appropriated powers no previous President had wielded: he used his war powers to proclaim a blockade, suspended the writ of habeas corpus, spent money without congressional authorization, and imprisoned 18,000 suspected Confederate sympathizers without trial. Nearly all of his actions, although vehemently denounced by the Copperheads, were subsequently upheld by Congress and the Courts.. Lincoln believed in the Whig theory of the presidency, which left Congress to write the laws while he signed them, vetoing only those bills that threatened his war powers. Thus, he signed the Homestead Act in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in 1869. Other important legislation involved economic matters, including the first income tax and higher tariffs. Also included was the creation of the system of national banks by the National Banking Acts of 1863, 1864, and 1865, which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system.  Congress created and Lincoln approved the Department of Agriculture in 1862, although that institution would not become a Cabinet-level department until 1889.. The Legal Tender Act of 1862 established the United States Note, the first paper currency in United States history.  This was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.. During the war, Lincoln's Treasury Department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied South—the most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.. In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope, to put down the \"Sioux Uprising\" in Minnesota. Presented with 303 death warrants for convicted Santee Dakota who had massacred innocent farmers, Lincoln affirmed 39 of these for execution (one was later reprieved).. The assassination of Abraham Lincoln. From left to right: Henry Rathbone, Clara Harris, Mary Todd Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth. Originally, John Wilkes Booth, a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland, had formulated a plan to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and determined to assassinate the president. Harrison, Lowell Hayes, Lincoln of Kentucky, University Press of Kentucky, 2000, pp. 3–4. ISBN 0813121566.  Learning that the President and First Lady, together with the Grants, would be attending Ford's Theatre, he laid his plans, assigning his co-conspirators to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward.. Without his main bodyguard Ward Hill Lamon, to whom he related his famous dream regarding his own assassination, Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14, 1865. As a lone bodyguard wandered, and Lincoln sat in his state box (Box 7) in the balcony, Booth crept up behind the President and waited for the funniest line of the play, hoping the laughter would muffle the noise of the gunshot. When the laughter began, Booth jumped into the box and aimed a single-shot, round-slug .44 caliber Henry Deringer at his head, firing at point-blank range. Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth but was cut by Booth's knife. Booth then leapt to the stage and shouted \"Sic semper tyrannis!\" (Latin: \"Thus always to tyrants\") and escaped, despite a broken leg suffered in the leap. George Alfred Townsend, The Life, Crime and Capture of John Wilkes Booth. New York: Dick & Fitzgerald, 1865. (LCCN  12002580.  A twelve-day manhunt ensued, in which Booth was chased by Federal agents (under the direction of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton). He was eventually cornered in a Virginia barn house  and shot, dying of his wounds soon after.. An army surgeon, Doctor Charles Leale, initially assessed Lincoln's wound as mortal. The President was taken across the street from the theater to the Petersen House, where he lay in a coma for nine hours before he died. Several physicians attended Lincoln, including U.S. Army Surgeon General Joseph K. Barnes of the Army Medical Museum. Using a probe, Barnes located some fragments of Lincoln's skull and the ball lodged 6 inches (15 cm) inside his brain. Lincoln never regained consciousness and was officially pronounced dead at 7:22:10 a.m. April 15, 1865 at the age of 56. There is some disagreement among historians as to Stanton's words after Lincoln died. All agree that he began \"Now he belongs to the...\" with some stating he said \"ages\" while others believe he said \"angels.\"  After Lincoln's body was returned to the White House, his body was prepared for his lying in repose in the East Room. He was the first president to lie in state.. The Army Medical Museum, now named the National Museum of Health and Medicine, has retained in its collection several artifacts relating to the assassination. Currently on display are the bullet that was fired from the Derringer pistol, the probe used by Barnes, pieces of Lincoln's skull and hair, and the surgeon's cuff stained with Lincoln's blood.. Lincoln's funeral train carried his remains, as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son William, 1,654 miles (2,661 km) to Illinois . Lincoln's body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to Illinois.  While much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the United States, Copperheads celebrated the death of a man they considered an unconstitutional tyrant. The Lincoln Tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, is 177 feet (54 m) tall and, by 1874, was surmounted with several bronze statues of Lincoln. To prevent repeated attempts to steal Lincoln's body and hold it for ransom, Robert Todd Lincoln had Lincoln exhumed and reinterred in concrete several feet thick in 1901.. With over 120 photographs taken of him, Lincoln was the most photographed man in the United States up to the time he was assassinated.. Lincoln was known for appointing political rivals to high positions in his cabinet to keep in line all factions of his party — and to let them battle each other and not combine against Lincoln. Historians agree that except for Simon Cameron, it was a highly effective group.. Abraham Lincoln's official White House portrait. Lincoln appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States:. In March 1860 in a speech in New Haven, Connecticut, Lincoln said, with respect to slavery, “Whenever this question shall be settled, it must be settled on some philosophical basis. No policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained.\" The philosophical basis for Lincoln’s beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that Lincoln be examined \"seriously as a man of ideas.\" Lincoln was a strong supporter of the American Whig version of liberal capitalism who, more than most politicians of the time, was able to express his ideas within the context of Nineteenth Century religious beliefs. Guelzo pg. 18-19. There were few people who strongly or directly influenced Lincoln’s moral and intellectual development and perspectives. There was no teacher, mentor, church leader, community leader, or peer that Lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. Lacking a formal education, Lincoln’s personal philosophy was shaped by \"an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning.\" It was Lincoln’s reading, rather than his relationships, that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs. Guelzo pg. 20. Miller pg. 57-59  Lincoln’s reading and study of the Bible was an integral part of his intellectual roots.. Lincoln did, even as a boy, largely reject organized religion, but the Calvinistic \"doctrine of necessity\" would remain a factor throughout his life. In 1846 Lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as \"that the human mind is impelled to action, or held in rest by some power, over which the mind itself has no control.\" Donald pg. 15. The quote came from a letter to the public in which Lincoln was denying charges by a political opponent that he was a “religious scoffer.”  In April 1864, in justifying his actions in regard to Emancipation, Lincoln wrote, \"I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of three years struggle the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. God alone can claim it.\" Donald pg. 514. As Lincoln matured, and especially during his term as president, the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. On a personal level, the death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace. Wilson pg. 251-254  After Willie’s death, in the summer or early fall of 1862, Lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary:. Lincoln’s religious skepticism was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the Lockean Enlightenment and classical liberalism, especially economic liberalism. Guelzo pg. 20  Consistent with the common practice of the Whig party, Lincoln would often use the Declaration of Independence as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies. Guelzo pg.194  In a February 22, 1861 speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia Lincoln said,. He found in the Declaration justification for Whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the nativist platform of the Know Nothings. In claiming that all men were created free, Lincoln and the Whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement, expanded education, territory to grow, and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population. Guelzo pg.194-195. It was the Declaration of Independence, rather than the Bible, that Lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. He saw the Declaration as more than a political document. To him, as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders, it was, foremost, a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation. Miller pg. 297. While Lincoln is usually portrayed bearded, he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year-old Grace Bedell. Lincoln's death made the President a martyr to many. Repeated polls of historians have ranked Lincoln as among the greatest presidents in U.S. history, often appearing in the first position. Among contemporary admirers, Lincoln is usually seen as personifying classical values of honesty and integrity, as well as respect for individual and minority rights, and human freedom in general.. Many American organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image, with interests ranging from the gay rights-supporting Log Cabin Republicans to the insurance corporation Lincoln National Corporation. The Lincoln automobile is also named after him. The ballistic missile submarine Abraham Lincoln (SSBN-602) and the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) were named in his honor. Also, the Liberty ship, SS Nancy Hanks was named to honor his mother. During the Spanish Civil War the American faction of the International Brigades named themselves the Abraham Lincoln Brigade after Lincoln.. Lincoln has been memorialized in many city names, notably the capital of Nebraska. Lincoln, Illinois, is the only city to be named for Abraham Lincoln before he became President. Lincoln's name and image appear in numerous places. These include the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., the U.S. Lincoln $5 bill and the Lincoln cent, Lincoln's sculpture on the Mount Rushmore, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois. In addition, New Salem, Illinois (a reconstruction of Lincoln's early adult hometown), Ford's Theatre, and Petersen House (where he died) are all preserved as museums. The Lincoln Shrine in Redlands, California, is located behind the A.K. Smiley Public Library. The state nickname for Illinois is Land of Lincoln.. Counties in 19 U.S. states (Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) are named after Lincoln.. Abraham Lincoln's birthday, February 12, was formerly a national holiday, now commemorated as Presidents' Day. However, it is still observed in Illinois and many other states as a separate legal holiday, Lincoln's Birthday. A dozen states have legal holidays celebrating the third Monday in February as 'Presidents' Day' as a combination Washington-Lincoln Day.. To commemorate his upcoming 200th birthday in February 2009, Congress established the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission (ALBC) in 2000. Dedicated to renewing American appreciation of Lincoln’s legacy, the 15-member commission is made up of lawmakers and scholars and also features an adivsory board of over 130 various Lincoln historians and enthusiasts. Located at Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., the ALBC is the organizing force behind numerous tributes, programs and cultural events highlighting a two-year celebration scheduled to begin in February 2008 at Lincoln’s birthplace:  Hodgenville, Kentucky.. Lincoln's birthplace and family home are national historic memorials: the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site in Hodgenville, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois.

              "2     Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the sixteenth President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1861 until his assassination. As an outspoken opponent of the expansion of slavery in the United States, \"[I]n his short autobiography written for the 1860 presidential campaign, Lincoln would describe his protest in the Illinois legislature as one that 'briefly defined his position on the slavery question, and so far as it goes, it was then the same that it is now.\" This was in reference to the anti-expansion sentiments he had then expressed. Doris Kearns Goodwin, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln (2005) p. 91.  Holzer pg. 232.  Writing of the Cooper Union  speech, Holzer notes, \"Cooper Union proved a unique confluence of political culture, rhetorical opportunity, technological innovation, and human genius, and it brought Abraham Lincoln to the center stage of American politics at precisely the right time and place, and with precisely the right message: that slavery was wrong, and ought to be confined to the areas where it already existed, and placed on the 'course of ultimate extinction... .'\"  Lincoln won the Republican Party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year. During his term, he helped preserve the United States by leading the defeat of the secessionist Confederate States of America in the American Civil War. He introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery, issuing his Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1865.. Lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including Ulysses S. Grant. Historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the Republican Party well, bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. Lincoln successfully defused a war scare with the United Kingdom in 1861. Under his leadership, the Union took control of the border slave states at the start of the war. Additionally, he managed his own reelection in the 1864 presidential election.. Opponents of the war (also known as \"Copperheads\") criticized him for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans, an abolitionist faction of the Republican Party, criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. Even with these problems, Lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches; his Gettysburg Address is but one example of this. At the close of the war, Lincoln held a moderate view of Reconstruction, seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. His assassination in 1865 was the first presidential assassination in U.S. history and made him a martyr for the ideal of national unity.. Scholars now rank Lincoln among the top three U.S. Presidents, with the majority of those surveyed placing him first. He is noted for his lasting influence on U.S. politics, including a redefinition of republicanism.  As Diggins explains, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.\" John Patrick Diggins, The Lost Soul of American Politics: Virtue, Self-interest, and the Foundations of Liberalism (1986) p. 307. Foner (1970) p. 215 noted that, \"Lincoln stressed the moral basis of Republicanism.\" Jaffa (2000) p. 399, stresses Lincoln's emphasis on the Declaration of Independence as what Lincoln called the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism. See also McPherson (1992) pp.61-64.. Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, to Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks, two uneducated farmers. Lincoln was born in a one-room log cabin on the   Sinking Spring Farm, in southeast Hardin County, Kentucky (now part of LaRue County). This area was at the time considered the \"frontier.\" The name \"Abraham\" was chosen to commemorate his grandfather, who was killed in an American Indian raid in 1786. Donald (1995) p 21  His elder sister, Sarah Lincoln, was born in 1807; a younger brother, Thomas Jr, died in infancy. It is sometimes debated whether Lincoln had Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of the connective tissue characterized by long limbs and great physical stature.  Marfan syndrome: Introduction Aug 1, 2006. Symbolic log cabin at Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site.. For some time, Thomas Lincoln was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the Kentucky back country. He had purchased the Sinking Spring Farm in December of 1808 for $200 cash and assumption of a debt.  The farm site is now preserved as part of Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site.  The family belonged to a Baptist church that had seceded from a larger church over the issue of slavery. Though Lincoln was exposed to his parents' anti-slavery sentiment from a very young age, he never joined their church, or any other church for that matter.  As a youth he had little use for religion. Life of Abraham Lincoln, Colonel Ward H. Lamon, 1872 - portions reprinted in  Chapter VIII: Abraham Lincoln, Deist, and Admirer of Thomas Paine, From the book Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents by Franklin Steiner (1936). Lincoln was just seven years old when, in 1816, the family was forced to make a new start in Perry County (now in Spencer County), Indiana. He later noted that this move was \"partly on account of slavery,\" and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in Kentucky: Unlike land in the Northwest Territory, Kentucky never had a proper U.S. survey, and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property. Lincoln was only nine when his mother, then thirty-four years old, died of milk sickness. Soon afterwards, his father remarried  to Sarah Bush Johnston. Sarah Lincoln raised young Lincoln like one of her own children. Years later she compared Lincoln to her own son, saying \"Both were good boys, but I must say — both now being dead that Abe was the best boy I ever saw or ever expect to see.\" Lincoln was affectionate toward his stepmother, whom he would call \"Mother\" for the rest of his life, but he was distant from his father.  Donald, (1995) pp. 28, 152.. In 1830, after more economic and land-title difficulties in Indiana, the family settled on public land  /ref> in Macon County, Illinois. Some scholars believe that it was his father's repeated land-title difficulties and ensuing financial hardships that led young Lincoln to study law.  The following winter was desolate and especially brutal, and the family considered moving back to Indiana. The following year, when his father relocated the family to a new homestead in Coles County, Illinois, twenty-two-year-old Lincoln struck out on his own, canoeing down the Sangamon River to the village of New Salem in Sangamon County. Later that year, hired by New Salem businessman Denton Offutt and accompanied by friends, he took goods from New Salem to New Orleans via flatboat on the Sangamon, Illinois and Mississippi rivers. While in New Orleans, he may have witnessed a slave auction, though as a frequent visitor to Kentucky, he would have had several earlier opportunities to witness  similar sales.  Donald, (1995) ch. 2.. Lincoln's formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling. Largely self-educated, he read every book he could get his hands on, once walking.  just to borrow one  While his favorite book was The Life of George Washington, Lincoln mastered the Bible, Shakespeare, and English and American history, and developed a plain writing style that puzzled audiences more used to grandiose rhetoric. He was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an ax; some rails he had allegedly split in his youth were exhibited at the 1860 Republican National Convention, as the party celebrated the poor-boy-made-good theme. Lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals, even for food. Though he was unusually tall at  , 4 inches and strong, Lincoln spent so much time reading that some neighbors suspected he must be doing it to avoid strenuous manual labor.. Young Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln began his political career in 1832, at age 23, with an unsuccessful campaign for the Illinois General Assembly, as a member of the Whig Party.  He ran eighth in a field of 13 candidates.  The centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the Sangamon River. He believed that this would attract steamboat traffic, which would allow the sparsely populated, poorer areas along the river to flourish.. He was elected captain of an Illinois militia company drawn from New Salem during the Black Hawk War, and later wrote that he had not had \"any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction.\"  Thomas (1952) 32-34; Basler (1946) p. 551   Though he never saw combat, Lincoln did assist in burying the dead from the Battle of Stillman's Run the day after Major Isaiah Stillman's troops fled the field of battle.  Abraham Lincoln Online Retrieved on March 11, 2007. For several months, Lincoln ran a small store in New Salem, selling tea, coffee, sugar, salt, blue calico, brown muslin, straw hats and whiskey.  Beveridge (1928) 1:127-8  Later, he found work as village postmaster and as a surveyor.. In 1834, he won election to the state legislature, and after coming across the Commentaries on the Laws of England, began to teach himself law. Admitted to the bar in 1837, he moved to Springfield, Illinois, that same year and began to practice law with John T. Stuart. With a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and in his closing arguments, Lincoln became one of the most respected and successful lawyers in Illinois and grew steadily more prosperous.. He served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a representative from Sangamon County, and became a leader of the Illinois Whig party. In 1837, he made his first protest against slavery in the Illinois House, stating that the institution was \"founded on both injustice and bad policy.\"  Protest in Illinois Legislature on Slavery, p.75, March 3, 1837  It was also in this same year that Lincoln met Joshua Fry Speed, who would become his most intimate friend.. Lincoln wrote a series of anonymous letters, published in 1842 in the Sangamon Journal, mocking State Auditor and prominent Democrat James Shields. Shields would later become a U.S. senator, but when he learned that it was Lincoln who had been writing the barbs, he challenged him to a duel. As Shields was the challenger, Lincoln was granted the right to choose the weapon and specified \"Cavalry broad swords of the largest size.\" Much taller and with long arms, this gave him an overwhelming advantage over his opponent; however, the duel was called off at the last minute. Beveridge (1928) 1:349. Lincoln had been practicing with the broad sword.  Two years later, Lincoln entered law practice with William Herndon, a fellow Whig. In 1854, both men joined the fledgling Republican Party. Following Lincoln's death, Herndon began collecting stories about Lincoln and published them in Herndon's Lincoln.. The first photograph ever taken of Mary Lincoln, a daguerreotype by Shepherd in 1846.. On November 4 1842 Lincoln married Mary Todd, daughter of a prominent slave-owning family from Kentucky. The couple had four sons. Robert Todd Lincoln was born in Springfield, Illinois on 1 August, 1843. Their only child to survive into adulthood, young Robert attended Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard College. Robert died on July 26, 1926, in Manchester, Vermont.. The other Lincoln children were born in Springfield, Illinois, and died either during childhood or their teen years. Edward Baker Lincoln was born on March 10, 1846, and died on 1 February, 1850, also in Springfield. William Wallace Lincoln was born on December 21, 1850, and died on February 20, 1862 in Washington, D.C., during Pres. Lincoln's first term. Thomas \"Tad\" Lincoln was born on 4 April, 1853, and died on July 16, 1871 in Chicago.. Four of his wife's brothers fought for the Confederacy, with one wounded and another killed in action. Lieutenant David H. Todd, a half-brother of Mary Todd Lincoln, served as commandant of the Libby Prison camp during the war.. The first photograph ever taken of Abraham Lincoln, a daguerreotype taken by Shepherd in 1846.. A Whig and an admirer of party leader Henry Clay,  Lincoln was elected to a term in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1846. As a freshman House member, he was not a particularly powerful or influential figure. He spoke out against the Mexican-American War, which he attributed to President Polk's desire for \"military glory — that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood.\" He also challenged the President's claims regarding the Texas boundary and offered Spot Resolutions demanding to know on what \"spot\" on US soil that blood was first spilt.  Congressional Globe, 30th Session (1848) pp.93-95  In January of 1848, he was among the 82 Whigs who defeated 81 Democrats in a procedural vote on an amendment to send a routine resolution back to committee with instructions to add the words \"a war unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the President of the United States.\" The amendment passed, but the bill never reemerged from committee and was never finally voted upon.  House Journal, 30th Session (1848) pp.183-184. Lincoln later damaged his political reputation with a speech in which he declared, \"God of Heaven has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent, and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men, women, and children, and lay waste and pillage the land of the just.\" Two weeks later, President Polk sent a peace treaty to Congress. While no one in Washington paid any attention to Lincoln, the Democrats orchestrated angry outbursts from across his district, where the war was popular and many had volunteered. In Morgan County, resolutions were adopted in fervent support of the war and in wrathful denunciation of the \"treasonable assaults of guerrillas at home; party demagogues; slanderers of the President; defenders of the butchery at the Alamo; traducers of the heroism at San Jacinto.\"  Abe Lincoln resource page. Warned by his law partner, William Herndon, that the damage was mounting and irreparable, Lincoln decided not to run for reelection. In fact, in 1848 he campaigned vigorously for Zachary Taylor, the successful general whose atrocities he had denounced in January. Regardless, his statements were not easily forgotten, and would haunt him during the Civil War. These statements were also held against him when he applied for a position in the new Taylor administration. Instead, Taylor's people offered Lincoln various positions in the remote Oregon Territory, primarily the governorship. Acceptance of this offer would have ended his career in the rapidly growing state of Illinois, so Lincoln declined the position. Returning to Springfield, Lincoln gave up politics for several years and turned his energies to his law practice. During this time, he made many trips on horseback between various counties' courthouses. Beveridge, (1928) 1: 428-33; Donald (1995) p. 140-43.. In the 1920s historical markers were placed at the county lines along the route Lincoln traveled in the eight judicial district. This example is on the border of Piatt and DeWitt counties. By the mid-1850s, Lincoln's caseload focused largely on the competing transportation interests of river barges and railroads. In one prominent 1851 case, he represented the Alton & Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with a shareholder, James A. Barret. Barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to the railroad on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. Lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest, that the newer route proposed by Alton & Sangamon was superior and less expensive, and that accordingly, the corporation had a right to sue Barret for his delinquent payment. He won this case, and the decision by the Illinois Supreme Court was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the United States. Donald, (1995) ch. 6.. Possibly the most notable criminal trial of Lincoln's career as a lawyer came in 1858, when he defended William \"Duff\" Armstrong, who has been charged with murder. The case became famous for Lincoln's use of judicial notice--a rare tactic at that time--to show that an eyewitness had lied on the stand. After the witness testified to having seen the crime by moonlight, Lincoln produced a Farmers' Almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle that it could not have provided enough illumination to see anything clearly. Based almost entirely on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted. Donald (1995), 150-51. Lincoln was involved in more than 5,100 cases in Illinois alone during his 23-year legal career. Though many of these cases involved little more than filing a writ, others were more substantial and quite involved. Lincoln and his partners appeared before the Illinois State Supreme Court more than 400 times. During one trial, Lincoln's voir dire included a question to prospective jurors as to whether they were acquainted with counsel for the other side. When a few of them turned out to know the other lawyer, the judge interrupted, saying, \"Mr. Lincoln, you are wasting the time of the court. The fact that a prospective juror knows your opponent does not disqualify him.\". \"No, Your Honor, I understand that,\" Lincoln answered. \"I'm afraid that some of them might not know him, which would place me at a disadvantage.\". Lincoln returned to politics in response to the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854), which expressly repealed the limits on slavery's extent as determined by the Missouri Compromise (1820). Illinois Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, the most powerful man in the Senate, proposed popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse, and incorporated it into the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory, rather than have such a decision imposed on them by Congress.  Donald, (1995) ch. 7.. In a speech against the act, on October 16 1854, delivered in Peoria, Lincoln first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day:. Drawing on remnants of the old Whig, Free Soil, Liberty and Democratic parties, he was instrumental in forming the new Republican Party. In a stirring campaign, the Republicans carried Illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. Lincoln was the obvious choice, but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an ex-Democrat Lyman Trumbull.. In 1857-58, Douglas broke with President Buchanan, leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state. Accepting the Republican nomination for Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered his famous speech: \"'A house divided against itself cannot stand.'(Mark 3:25) I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.\"  A House Divided Against Itself Cannot Stand, June 1858  The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the north.. The 1858 campaign featured the Lincoln-Douglas debates, a nationally famous contest on slavery. Lincoln warned that the \"Slave Power\" was threatening the values of republicanism, while Douglas emphasized the supremacy of democracy, as set forth in his Freeport Doctrine, which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not. Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature reelected Douglas to the Senate. Nevertheless, Lincoln's eloquence transformed him into a national political star.. During the debates of 1858, the issue of race was often discussed. During a time period when few believed in racial egalitarianism, Stephen Douglas informed the crowds, \"If you desire Negro citizenship… if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves… then support Mr. Lincoln and the Black Republican party, who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro.\"  First Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Ottawa, Illinois, August 21, 1858  Lincoln countered that he was \"not in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races.\"  Fourth Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Charleston, Illinois, September 18, 1858  His opposition to slavery was opposition to the Slave Power, though this would change during the course of the Civil War. Donald, (1995) ch. 8.. On May 9-10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur. At this convention, Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.. \"The Rail Candidate,\" Lincoln's 1860 candidacy is held up by slavery issue (slave on left) and party organization (New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley on right). Photo of Lincoln taken February 27, 1860 in New York City by Mathew Brady, the day of his famous Cooper Union speech.. Entering the presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog, Lincoln was eventually chosen as the Republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. His expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase. His \"Western\" origins also appealed to the newer states: other contenders, especially those with more governmental experience, had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states, while Lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the West. Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government. Yet despite his Southern connections (his in-laws owned slaves), Lincoln misunderstood the depth of the revolution underway in the South and the emergence of Southern nationalism. Throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war, and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession.  Gabor S. Boritt, \"'And the War Came'? Abraham Lincoln and the Question of Individual Responsibility,\" Why the Civil War Came ed by Boritt (1996), pp 3-30.. Throughout the election, Lincoln did not campaign or give speeches. This was handled by the state and county Republican organizations, who used the latest techniques to sustain party enthusiasm and thus obtain high turnout. There was little effort to convert non-Republicans, and there was virtually no campaigning in the South except for a few border cities such as St. Louis, Missouri, and Wheeling, Virginia; indeed, the party did not even run a slate in most of the South. In the North, there were thousands of Republican speakers, tons of campaign posters and leaflets, and thousands of newspaper editorials. These focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, making the most of his boyhood poverty, his pioneer background, his native genius, and his rise from obscurity. His nicknames, \"Honest Abe\" and \"the Rail-Splitter,\" were exploited to the full. The goal was to emphasize the superior power of \"free labor,\" whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts.  Thomas (1952) p 216; Reinhard H. Luthin, The First Lincoln Campaign (1944); Nevins vol 4;. On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, John C. Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and John Bell of the new Constitutional Union Party. He was the first Republican president, winning entirely on the strength of his support in the North: he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the South, and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other Southern states. Lincoln gained 1,865,908 votes (39.9% of the total), for 180 electoral votes; Douglas, 1,380,202 (29.5%) for 12 electoral votes; Breckenridge, 848,019 (18.1%) for 72 electoral votes; and Bell, 590,901 (12.5%) for 39 electoral votes. There were fusion tickets in some states, but even if his opponents had combined in every state, Lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election.. As Lincoln's election became more likely, secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the Union. South Carolina took the lead, followed by six other cotton-growing states in the deep South. The upper South (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to and rejected the secessionist appeal. They decided to stay in the Union, though they warned Lincoln that they would not support an invasion through their territory. The seven Confederate states seceded before Lincoln took office, declaring themselves to be a new nation, the Confederate States of America. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy.. President-elect Lincoln evaded possible assassins in Baltimore, and on February 23, 1861, arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C. At his inauguration on March 4, 1861, the German American Turners formed Lincoln's bodyguard; and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present, ready to protect the capital from Confederate invasion and local insurrection.. Photograph showing the March 4, 1861, inauguration of Abraham Lincoln in front of United States Capitol.. In his First Inaugural Address, Lincoln declared, \"I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments,\" arguing further that the purpose of the United States Constitution was \"to form a more perfect union\" than the Articles of Confederation which were explicitly perpetual, thus the Constitution too was perpetual. He asked rhetorically that even were the Constitution a simple contract, would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?. Also in his inaugural address, in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war, Lincoln supported the pending Corwin Amendment to the Constitution, which had already passed Congress. This amendment, which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it existed, was designed to appeal not to the Confederacy but to the critical border states. At the same time, Lincoln adamantly opposed the Crittenden Compromise, which would have permitted slavery in the territories. Despite support for the Crittenden compromise among some prominent Republicans (including William Seward), Lincoln denounced it saying that it \"would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people, tribe, and state owning a foot of land between here and Tierra del Fuego.\". By the time Lincoln took office, the Confederacy was an established fact, and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. No compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. Lincoln might have allowed the southern states to secede, and some Republicans recommended that. However, conservative Democratic nationalists, such as Jeremiah S. Black, Joseph Holt, and Edwin M. Stanton had taken control of Buchanan's cabinet around January 1, 1861, and refused to accept secession. Lincoln and nearly every Republican leader adopted this position by March 1861: the Union could not be dismantled. However, as a strict follower of the constitution, Lincoln refused to take any action against the South unless the Unionists themselves were attacked first. This finally happened in April 1861.. Historian Allan Nevins argues that Lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the Union, hold government property, and still avoid war. He \"temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis,\" overestimated the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South and border states, and misunderstood the conditional support of Unionists in the border states.  Allan Nevins, The Improvised War, 1861-1862 (1959) p 29. In April 1861, after Union troops at Fort Sumter were fired upon and forced to surrender, Lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and \"preserve the Union,\" which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. Virginia, which had repeatedly warned Lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state, responded by seceding, along with North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas.. The slave states of Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware did not secede, and Lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there, promising not to interfere with slavery. After the fighting started, he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas (especially in Maryland) and held in military prisons without trial. Over 18,000 were arrested, though none were executed. One, Clement Vallandigham, was exiled; but all of the remainder were released, usually after two or three months (see: Ex parte Merryman).. Lincoln met with his cabinet for the first reading of the Emancipation Proclamation draft on July 22, 1862. L-R: Edwin M. Stanton, Salmon P. Chase, Abraham Lincoln, Gideon Welles, Caleb B. Smith, William H. Seward, Montgomery Blair and Edward Bates. In July 1862, Congress moved to free the slaves by passing the Second Confiscation Act. The goal was to weaken the rebellion, which was led and controlled by slave owners. While it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery (the Thirteenth Amendment did that), the Act showed that Lincoln had the support of Congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. This new law was implemented with Lincoln's \"Emancipation Proclamation.\". Lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the United States. In 1861 – 1862, however, he made it clear that the North was fighting the war to preserve the Union, not to abolish slavery. Freeing the slaves became, in late 1862, a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. Abolitionists criticized Lincoln for his sluggishness over slavery per se, but on August 22, 1862, Lincoln explained:. The Emancipation Proclamation, announced on September 22 and put into effect on January 1, 1863, freed slaves in territories not under Union control. As Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all of them in Confederate hands (over three million) were freed. Lincoln later said: \"I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.\" The proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. Lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation. Lincoln addressed the issue of his consistency in an 1864 letter to Albert G. Hodges.  Letter to Albert G. Hodges, April 4, 1864. In September 1862, thirteen northern governors met in Altoona, Pennsylvania, at the Loyal War Governors' Conference to discuss the Proclamation and Union war effort. In the end, the state executives fully supported the president's Proclamation and also suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union's Army of the Potomac.  Images of America: Altoona, by Sr. Anne Francis Pulling, 2001, 10.. For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. As Frederick Douglass observed, Lincoln was, \"The first great man that I talked with in the United States freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself, of the difference of color.\" Life and Times of Frederick Douglass, by Frederick Douglass, 1895. After Union victories at Gettysburg, Vicksburg and Chattanooga in 1863, victory seemed at hand, and Lincoln promoted Ulysses S. Grant General-in-Chief ( March 12, 1864). When the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates, Lincoln supported Grant's strategy of wearing down Lee's Confederate army at the cost of heavy Union casualties. With an election looming, he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. At the Convention, the Republican Party selected Andrew Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. They ran on the new Union Party ticket uniting Republicans and War Democrats.. Lincoln, in top hat, with Allan Pinkerton and Gen. John Alexander McClernand at Antietam.. Nevertheless, Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Acknowledging this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would nonetheless defeat the Confederacy by an all-out military effort before turning over the White House: Mark Grimsley and Brooks D Simpson, eds. The Collapse of the Confederacy (2001) p 80. Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.. While the Democratic platform followed the Peace wing of the party and called the war a \"failure,\" their candidate, General George B. McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform.. Lincoln provided Grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to support Grant and win local support for the war effort. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September ended defeatist jitters; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln; the Union party was united and energized, and Lincoln was easily reelected in a landslide. He won all but two states, capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.. On March 4 1865, Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address, his favorite of all his speeches. At this time, a victory over the rebels was at hand, slavery was dead, and Lincoln was looking to the future.. “Running the ‘Machine’”. An 1864 cartoon featuring Lincoln, William Fessenden, Edwin Stanton, William Seward and Gideon Welles takes a swing at the Lincoln administration. The war was a source of constant frustration for the president, and occupied nearly all of his time. He had a contentious relationship with General McClellan, who became general-in-chief of all the Union armies in the wake of the embarrassing Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run and after the retirement of Winfield Scott in late 1861. Despite his inexperience in military affairs, Lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. His priorities were twofold: to ensure that Washington, D.C., was well defended; and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the Northern public and press. McClellan, a youthful West Point graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service, took a more cautious approach. He took several months to plan and execute his Peninsula Campaign, with the objective of capturing Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula between the James and York Rivers. McClellan's delay irritated Lincoln, as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend Washington, D.C. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops to defend the capital, a decision McClellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.. McClellan, a lifelong Democrat who was temperamentally conservative, was relieved as general-in-chief after releasing his Harrison's Landing Letter, where he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint John Pope, a Republican, as head of the new Army of Virginia. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack. But Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. In response to his failure, Pope was sent to Minnesota to fight the Sioux.. An 1864 Mathew Brady photo depicts President Lincoln reading a book with his youngest son, Tad. Panicked by Lee's invasion of Maryland, Lincoln restored McClellan to command of all forces around Washington in time for the Battle of Antietam (September 1862). The ensuing Union victory enabled Lincoln to release his Emancipation Proclamation, but he relieved McClellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed Republican Ambrose Burnside to head the Army of the Potomac. Burnside had promised to follow through on Lincoln's strategic vision for a strong offensive against Lee and Richmond. After Burnside was stunningly defeated at Fredericksburg, Joseph Hooker was given the command, despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders.  Joseph Hooker biography  Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville (May 1863), and relieved of command early in the subsequent Gettysburg Campaign replaced by George Meade.. After the Union victory at Gettysburg, Meade's failure to pursue Lee and months of inactivity for the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to bring in a western general, Ulysses S. Grant. Grant already had a solid string of victories in the Western Theater, including the battles of Vicksburg and Chattanooga. Responding to criticism of Grant, Lincoln was quoted as saying, \"I cannot spare this man. He fights.\" Grant waged his bloody Overland Campaign in 1864 with a strategy of a war of attrition, characterized by high Union losses at battles such as the Wilderness and Cold Harbor, but by proportionately higher Confederate losses. His invasion campaign eventually bottled Lee up in the Siege of Petersburg, so that Grant could take Richmond, and bring the war to a close in the spring of 1865.. Lincoln authorized Grant to target civilians and infrastructure, hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. This allowed Generals Sherman and Sheridan to destroy farms and towns in the Shenandoah Valley, Georgia, and South Carolina. The damage caused by Sherman's March to the Sea through Georgia totaled in excess of $100 million by Sherman's own estimate. See Hofstadter, Richard, The United States: The History of a Republic, Prentice-Hall, 1967, p. 446.. Lincoln had a star-crossed record as a military leader, possessing a keen understanding of strategic points (such as the Mississippi River and the fortress city of Vicksburg) and the importance of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing cities. He had, however, limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863, when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in Ulysses S. Grant. Only then could he insist on using African American troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.. Throughout the war, Lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. He spent hours at the War Department telegraph office, reading dispatches from his generals. He visited battle sites frequently, and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. During Jubal Anderson Early's raid on Washington, D.C. in 1864, Lincoln had to be told to duck to avoid being shot while observing the battle.. Reconstruction began during the war as Lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the Southern states and what to do with Confederate leaders and the freed slaves. Lincoln led the \"moderates\" regarding Reconstructionist policy, and was usually opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Thaddeus Stevens in the House and Charles Sumner and Benjamin Wade in the Senate (though he cooperated with these men on most other issues). Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind Union lines. His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.  /ref> Critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. Of special importance were Tennessee, where Lincoln appointed Andrew Johnson as governor, and Louisiana, where Lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. The Radicals thought this policy too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864. When Lincoln pocket-vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.  Donald (1995) ch. 20. On April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House in Virginia, and the war was effectively over. The other rebel armies surrendered soon after, and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare. Lincoln went to Richmond to make a public gesture of sitting at Jefferson Davis's own desk, symbolically saying to the nation that the President of the United States held authority over the entire land. He was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves, whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer's quote, \"I know I am free for I have seen the face of Father Abraham and have felt him.\" When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, Lincoln replied, \"Let 'em up easy.\"  Donald (1995) 576, 580,   \"President Lincoln Enters Richmond, 1865\" EyeWitness to History, www.eywitnesstohistory.com (2000).. One of the last photographs of Lincoln, likely taken between February and April 1865. Lincoln's powerful rhetoric defined the issues of the war for the nation, the world, and posterity. His extraordinary command of the English language was evidenced in the Gettysburg Address, a speech dedicating the cemetery at Gettysburg that he delivered on November 19, 1863. The speech defied Lincoln's own prediction that \"the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here.\" Lincoln's second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted. In these speeches, Lincoln articulated better than anyone else the rationale behind the Union cause.. In recent years, historians have stressed Lincoln's use of and redefinition of republican values. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln shifted emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism.  Jaffa (2000) p. 399  The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, rather than the Constitution's tolerance of slavers, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.\"  John Patrick Diggins, The Lost Soul of American Politics: Virtue, Self-interest, and the Foundations of Liberalism (1986) p. 307.  His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.  Foner (1970) p. 215 says, \"Lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism.\"  See also McPherson (1992) pp.61-64.  Nevertheless, in 1861 Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a \"republican form of government\" in every state. Jaffa (2000) p. 263  That duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in Reconstruction.. Lincoln's second inauguration on March 4, 1865. In the photo, Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth, can be seen in the crowd at the top and accomplices David Herold, Lewis Powell, George Atzerodt, John Surratt and Edmund Spangler in the bottom crowd. In his Gettysburg Address Lincoln redefined the American nation, arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776, \"conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\" He declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality, \"that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\" By emphasizing the centrality of the nation, he rebuffed the claims of state sovereignty. While some critics say Lincoln moved too far and too fast,  H.L. Mencken said \"It is difficult to imagine anything more untrue. The Union soldiers in the battle actually fought against self-determination; it was the Confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves.\" Mencken did not mention the right of self-determination rights for blacks.   they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked \"a new founding of the nation.\"  Wills (1992) p. 39.. During the Civil War, Lincoln appropriated powers no previous President had wielded: he used his war powers to proclaim a blockade, suspended the writ of habeas corpus, spent money without congressional authorization, and imprisoned 18,000 suspected Confederate sympathizers without trial. Nearly all of his actions, although vehemently denounced by the Copperheads, were subsequently upheld by Congress and the Courts.. Lincoln believed in the Whig theory of the presidency, which left Congress to write the laws while he signed them, vetoing only those bills that threatened his war powers. Thus, he signed the Homestead Act in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in 1869. Other important legislation involved economic matters, including the first income tax and higher tariffs. Also included was the creation of the system of national banks by the National Banking Acts of 1863, 1864, and 1865, which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system.  Congress created and Lincoln approved the Department of Agriculture in 1862, although that institution would not become a Cabinet-level department until 1889.. The Legal Tender Act of 1862 established the United States Note, the first paper currency in United States history.  This was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.. During the war, Lincoln's Treasury Department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied South—the most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.. In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope, to put down the \"Sioux Uprising\" in Minnesota. Presented with 303 death warrants for convicted Santee Dakota who had massacred innocent farmers, Lincoln affirmed 39 of these for execution (one was later reprieved).. The assassination of Abraham Lincoln. From left to right: Henry Rathbone, Clara Harris, Mary Todd Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth. Originally, John Wilkes Booth, a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland, had formulated a plan to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and determined to assassinate the president. Harrison, Lowell Hayes, Lincoln of Kentucky, University Press of Kentucky, 2000, pp. 3–4. ISBN 0813121566.  Learning that the President and First Lady, together with the Grants, would be attending Ford's Theatre, he laid his plans, assigning his co-conspirators to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward.. Without his main bodyguard Ward Hill Lamon, to whom he related his famous dream regarding his own assassination, Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14, 1865. As a lone bodyguard wandered, and Lincoln sat in his state box (Box 7) in the balcony, Booth crept up behind the President and waited for the funniest line of the play, hoping the laughter would muffle the noise of the gunshot. When the laughter began, Booth jumped into the box and aimed a single-shot, round-slug .44 caliber Henry Deringer at his head, firing at point-blank range. Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth but was cut by Booth's knife. Booth then leapt to the stage and shouted \"Sic semper tyrannis!\" (Latin: \"Thus always to tyrants\") and escaped, despite a broken leg suffered in the leap. George Alfred Townsend, The Life, Crime and Capture of John Wilkes Booth. New York: Dick & Fitzgerald, 1865. (LCCN  12002580.  A twelve-day manhunt ensued, in which Booth was chased by Federal agents (under the direction of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton). He was eventually cornered in a Virginia barn house  and shot, dying of his wounds soon after.. An army surgeon, Doctor Charles Leale, initially assessed Lincoln's wound as mortal. The President was taken across the street from the theater to the Petersen House, where he lay in a coma for nine hours before he died. Several physicians attended Lincoln, including U.S. Army Surgeon General Joseph K. Barnes of the Army Medical Museum. Using a probe, Barnes located some fragments of Lincoln's skull and the ball lodged 6 inches (15 cm) inside his brain. Lincoln never regained consciousness and was officially pronounced dead at 7:22:10 a.m. April 15, 1865 at the age of 56. There is some disagreement among historians as to Stanton's words after Lincoln died. All agree that he began \"Now he belongs to the...\" with some stating he said \"ages\" while others believe he said \"angels.\"  After Lincoln's body was returned to the White House, his body was prepared for his lying in repose in the East Room. He was the first president to lie in state.. The Army Medical Museum, now named the National Museum of Health and Medicine, has retained in its collection several artifacts relating to the assassination. Currently on display are the bullet that was fired from the Derringer pistol, the probe used by Barnes, pieces of Lincoln's skull and hair, and the surgeon's cuff stained with Lincoln's blood.. Lincoln's funeral train carried his remains, as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son William, 1,654 miles (2,661 km) to Illinois . Lincoln's body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to Illinois.  While much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the United States, Copperheads celebrated the death of a man they considered an unconstitutional tyrant. The Lincoln Tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, is 177 feet (54 m) tall and, by 1874, was surmounted with several bronze statues of Lincoln. To prevent repeated attempts to steal Lincoln's body and hold it for ransom, Robert Todd Lincoln had Lincoln exhumed and reinterred in concrete several feet thick in 1901.. With over 120 photographs taken of him, Lincoln was the most photographed man in the United States up to the time he was assassinated.. Lincoln was known for appointing political rivals to high positions in his cabinet to keep in line all factions of his party — and to let them battle each other and not combine against Lincoln. Historians agree that except for Simon Cameron, it was a highly effective group.. Abraham Lincoln's official White House portrait. Lincoln appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States:. In March 1860 in a speech in New Haven, Connecticut, Lincoln said, with respect to slavery, “Whenever this question shall be settled, it must be settled on some philosophical basis. No policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained.\" The philosophical basis for Lincoln’s beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that Lincoln be examined \"seriously as a man of ideas.\" Lincoln was a strong supporter of the American Whig version of liberal capitalism who, more than most politicians of the time, was able to express his ideas within the context of Nineteenth Century religious beliefs. Guelzo pg. 18-19. There were few people who strongly or directly influenced Lincoln’s moral and intellectual development and perspectives. There was no teacher, mentor, church leader, community leader, or peer that Lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. Lacking a formal education, Lincoln’s personal philosophy was shaped by \"an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning.\" It was Lincoln’s reading, rather than his relationships, that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs. Guelzo pg. 20. Miller pg. 57-59  Lincoln’s reading and study of the Bible was an integral part of his intellectual roots.. Lincoln did, even as a boy, largely reject organized religion, but the Calvinistic \"doctrine of necessity\" would remain a factor throughout his life. In 1846 Lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as \"that the human mind is impelled to action, or held in rest by some power, over which the mind itself has no control.\" Donald pg. 15. The quote came from a letter to the public in which Lincoln was denying charges by a political opponent that he was a “religious scoffer.”  In April 1864, in justifying his actions in regard to Emancipation, Lincoln wrote, \"I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of three years struggle the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. God alone can claim it.\" Donald pg. 514. As Lincoln matured, and especially during his term as president, the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. On a personal level, the death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace. Wilson pg. 251-254  After Willie’s death, in the summer or early fall of 1862, Lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary:. Lincoln’s religious skepticism was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the Lockean Enlightenment and classical liberalism, especially economic liberalism. Guelzo pg. 20  Consistent with the common practice of the Whig party, Lincoln would often use the Declaration of Independence as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies. Guelzo pg.194  In a February 22, 1861 speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia Lincoln said,. He found in the Declaration justification for Whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the nativist platform of the Know Nothings. In claiming that all men were created free, Lincoln and the Whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement, expanded education, territory to grow, and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population. Guelzo pg.194-195. It was the Declaration of Independence, rather than the Bible, that Lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. He saw the Declaration as more than a political document. To him, as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders, it was, foremost, a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation. Miller pg. 297. While Lincoln is usually portrayed bearded, he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year-old Grace Bedell. Lincoln's death made the President a martyr to many. Repeated polls of historians have ranked Lincoln as among the greatest presidents in U.S. history, often appearing in the first position. Among contemporary admirers, Lincoln is usually seen as personifying classical values of honesty and integrity, as well as respect for individual and minority rights, and human freedom in general.. Many American organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image, with interests ranging from the gay rights-supporting Log Cabin Republicans to the insurance corporation Lincoln National Corporation. The Lincoln automobile is also named after him. The ballistic missile submarine Abraham Lincoln (SSBN-602) and the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) were named in his honor. Also, the Liberty ship, SS Nancy Hanks was named to honor his mother. During the Spanish Civil War the American faction of the International Brigades named themselves the Abraham Lincoln Brigade after Lincoln.. Lincoln has been memorialized in many city names, notably the capital of Nebraska. Lincoln, Illinois, is the only city to be named for Abraham Lincoln before he became President. Lincoln's name and image appear in numerous places. These include the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., the U.S. Lincoln $5 bill and the Lincoln cent, Lincoln's sculpture on the Mount Rushmore, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois. In addition, New Salem, Illinois (a reconstruction of Lincoln's early adult hometown), Ford's Theatre, and Petersen House (where he died) are all preserved as museums. The Lincoln Shrine in Redlands, California, is located behind the A.K. Smiley Public Library. The state nickname for Illinois is Land of Lincoln.. Counties in 19 U.S. states (Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) are named after Lincoln.. Abraham Lincoln's birthday, February 12, was formerly a national holiday, now commemorated as Presidents' Day. However, it is still observed in Illinois and many other states as a separate legal holiday, Lincoln's Birthday. A dozen states have legal holidays celebrating the third Monday in February as 'Presidents' Day' as a combination Washington-Lincoln Day.. To commemorate his upcoming 200th birthday in February 2009, Congress established the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission (ALBC) in 2000. Dedicated to renewing American appreciation of Lincoln’s legacy, the 15-member commission is made up of lawmakers and scholars and also features an adivsory board of over 130 various Lincoln historians and enthusiasts. Located at Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., the ALBC is the organizing force behind numerous tributes, programs and cultural events highlighting a two-year celebration scheduled to begin in February 2008 at Lincoln’s birthplace:  Hodgenville, Kentucky.. Lincoln's birthplace and family home are national historic memorials: the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site in Hodgenville, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois. The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum opened in Springfield in 2005; it is a major tourist attraction, with state-of-the-art exhibits.

              "3     Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the sixteenth President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1861 until his assassination. As an outspoken opponent of the expansion of slavery in the United States, \"[I]n his short autobiography written for the 1860 presidential campaign, Lincoln would describe his protest in the Illinois legislature as one that 'briefly defined his position on the slavery question, and so far as it goes, it was then the same that it is now.\" This was in reference to the anti-expansion sentiments he had then expressed. Doris Kearns Goodwin, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln (2005) p. 91.  Holzer pg. 232.  Writing of the Cooper Union  speech, Holzer notes, \"Cooper Union proved a unique confluence of political culture, rhetorical opportunity, technological innovation, and human genius, and it brought Abraham Lincoln to the center stage of American politics at precisely the right time and place, and with precisely the right message: that slavery was wrong, and ought to be confined to the areas where it already existed, and placed on the 'course of ultimate extinction... .'\"  Lincoln won the Republican Party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year. During his term, he helped preserve the United States by leading the defeat of the secessionist Confederate States of America in the American Civil War. He introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery, issuing his Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1865.. Lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including Ulysses S. Grant. Historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the Republican Party well, bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. Lincoln successfully defused a war scare with the United Kingdom in 1861. Under his leadership, the Union took control of the border slave states at the start of the war. Additionally, he managed his own reelection in the 1864 presidential election.. Opponents of the war (also known as \"Copperheads\") criticized him for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans, an abolitionist faction of the Republican Party, criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. Even with these problems, Lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches; his Gettysburg Address is but one example of this. At the close of the war, Lincoln held a moderate view of Reconstruction, seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. His assassination in 1865 was the first presidential assassination in U.S. history and made him a martyr for the ideal of national unity.. Scholars now rank Lincoln among the top three U.S. Presidents, with the majority of those surveyed placing him first. He is noted for his lasting influence on U.S. politics, including a redefinition of republicanism.  As Diggins explains, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.\" John Patrick Diggins, The Lost Soul of American Politics: Virtue, Self-interest, and the Foundations of Liberalism (1986) p. 307. Foner (1970) p. 215 noted that, \"Lincoln stressed the moral basis of Republicanism.\" Jaffa (2000) p. 399, stresses Lincoln's emphasis on the Declaration of Independence as what Lincoln called the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism. See also McPherson (1992) pp.61-64.. Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, to Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks, two uneducated farmers. Lincoln was born in a one-room log cabin on the   Sinking Spring Farm, in southeast Hardin County, Kentucky (now part of LaRue County). This area was at the time considered the \"frontier.\" The name \"Abraham\" was chosen to commemorate his grandfather, who was killed in an American Indian raid in 1786. Donald (1995) p 21  His elder sister, Sarah Lincoln, was born in 1807; a younger brother, Thomas Jr, died in infancy. It is sometimes debated whether Lincoln had Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of the connective tissue characterized by long limbs and great physical stature.  Marfan syndrome: Introduction Aug 1, 2006. Symbolic log cabin at Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site.. For some time, Thomas Lincoln was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the Kentucky back country. He had purchased the Sinking Spring Farm in December of 1808 for $200 cash and assumption of a debt.  The farm site is now preserved as part of Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site.  The family belonged to a Baptist church that had seceded from a larger church over the issue of slavery. Though Lincoln was exposed to his parents' anti-slavery sentiment from a very young age, he never joined their church, or any other church for that matter.  As a youth he had little use for religion. Life of Abraham Lincoln, Colonel Ward H. Lamon, 1872 - portions reprinted in  Chapter VIII: Abraham Lincoln, Deist, and Admirer of Thomas Paine, From the book Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents by Franklin Steiner (1936). Lincoln was just seven years old when, in 1816, the family was forced to make a new start in Perry County (now in Spencer County), Indiana. He later noted that this move was \"partly on account of slavery,\" and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in Kentucky: Unlike land in the Northwest Territory, Kentucky never had a proper U.S. survey, and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property. Lincoln was only nine when his mother, then thirty-four years old, died of milk sickness. Soon afterwards, his father remarried  to Sarah Bush Johnston. Sarah Lincoln raised young Lincoln like one of her own children. Years later she compared Lincoln to her own son, saying \"Both were good boys, but I must say — both now being dead that Abe was the best boy I ever saw or ever expect to see.\" Lincoln was affectionate toward his stepmother, whom he would call \"Mother\" for the rest of his life, but he was distant from his father.  Donald, (1995) pp. 28, 152.. In 1830, after more economic and land-title difficulties in Indiana, the family settled on public land  /ref> in Macon County, Illinois. Some scholars believe that it was his father's repeated land-title difficulties and ensuing financial hardships that led young Lincoln to study law.  The following winter was desolate and especially brutal, and the family considered moving back to Indiana. The following year, when his father relocated the family to a new homestead in Coles County, Illinois, twenty-two-year-old Lincoln struck out on his own, canoeing down the Sangamon River to the village of New Salem in Sangamon County. Later that year, hired by New Salem businessman Denton Offutt and accompanied by friends, he took goods from New Salem to New Orleans via flatboat on the Sangamon, Illinois and Mississippi rivers. While in New Orleans, he may have witnessed a slave auction, though as a frequent visitor to Kentucky, he would have had several earlier opportunities to witness  similar sales.  Donald, (1995) ch. 2.. Lincoln's formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling. Largely self-educated, he read every book he could get his hands on, once walking.  just to borrow one  While his favorite book was The Life of George Washington, Lincoln mastered the Bible, Shakespeare, and English and American history, and developed a plain writing style that puzzled audiences more used to grandiose rhetoric. He was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an ax; some rails he had allegedly split in his youth were exhibited at the 1860 Republican National Convention, as the party celebrated the poor-boy-made-good theme. Lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals, even for food. Though he was unusually tall at  , 4 inches and strong, Lincoln spent so much time reading that some neighbors suspected he must be doing it to avoid strenuous manual labor.. Young Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln began his political career in 1832, at age 23, with an unsuccessful campaign for the Illinois General Assembly, as a member of the Whig Party.  He ran eighth in a field of 13 candidates.  The centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the Sangamon River. He believed that this would attract steamboat traffic, which would allow the sparsely populated, poorer areas along the river to flourish.. He was elected captain of an Illinois militia company drawn from New Salem during the Black Hawk War, and later wrote that he had not had \"any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction.\"  Thomas (1952) 32-34; Basler (1946) p. 551   Though he never saw combat, Lincoln did assist in burying the dead from the Battle of Stillman's Run the day after Major Isaiah Stillman's troops fled the field of battle.  Abraham Lincoln Online Retrieved on March 11, 2007. For several months, Lincoln ran a small store in New Salem, selling tea, coffee, sugar, salt, blue calico, brown muslin, straw hats and whiskey.  Beveridge (1928) 1:127-8  Later, he found work as village postmaster and as a surveyor.. In 1834, he won election to the state legislature, and after coming across the Commentaries on the Laws of England, began to teach himself law. Admitted to the bar in 1837, he moved to Springfield, Illinois, that same year and began to practice law with John T. Stuart. With a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and in his closing arguments, Lincoln became one of the most respected and successful lawyers in Illinois and grew steadily more prosperous.. He served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a representative from Sangamon County, and became a leader of the Illinois Whig party. In 1837, he made his first protest against slavery in the Illinois House, stating that the institution was \"founded on both injustice and bad policy.\"  Protest in Illinois Legislature on Slavery, p.75, March 3, 1837  It was also in this same year that Lincoln met Joshua Fry Speed, who would become his most intimate friend.. Lincoln wrote a series of anonymous letters, published in 1842 in the Sangamon Journal, mocking State Auditor and prominent Democrat James Shields. Shields would later become a U.S. senator, but when he learned that it was Lincoln who had been writing the barbs, he challenged him to a duel. As Shields was the challenger, Lincoln was granted the right to choose the weapon and specified \"Cavalry broad swords of the largest size.\" Much taller and with long arms, this gave him an overwhelming advantage over his opponent; however, the duel was called off at the last minute. Beveridge (1928) 1:349. Lincoln had been practicing with the broad sword.  Two years later, Lincoln entered law practice with William Herndon, a fellow Whig. In 1854, both men joined the fledgling Republican Party. Following Lincoln's death, Herndon began collecting stories about Lincoln and published them in Herndon's Lincoln.. The first photograph ever taken of Mary Lincoln, a daguerreotype by Shepherd in 1846.. On November 4 1842 Lincoln married Mary Todd, daughter of a prominent slave-owning family from Kentucky. The couple had four sons. Robert Todd Lincoln was born in Springfield, Illinois on 1 August, 1843. Their only child to survive into adulthood, young Robert attended Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard College. Robert died on July 26, 1926, in Manchester, Vermont.. The other Lincoln children were born in Springfield, Illinois, and died either during childhood or their teen years. Edward Baker Lincoln was born on March 10, 1846, and died on 1 February, 1850, also in Springfield. William Wallace Lincoln was born on December 21, 1850, and died on February 20, 1862 in Washington, D.C., during Pres. Lincoln's first term. Thomas \"Tad\" Lincoln was born on 4 April, 1853, and died on July 16, 1871 in Chicago.. Four of his wife's brothers fought for the Confederacy, with one wounded and another killed in action. Lieutenant David H. Todd, a half-brother of Mary Todd Lincoln, served as commandant of the Libby Prison camp during the war.. The first photograph ever taken of Abraham Lincoln, a daguerreotype taken by Shepherd in 1846.. A Whig and an admirer of party leader Henry Clay,  Lincoln was elected to a term in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1846. As a freshman House member, he was not a particularly powerful or influential figure. He spoke out against the Mexican-American War, which he attributed to President Polk's desire for \"military glory — that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood.\" He also challenged the President's claims regarding the Texas boundary and offered Spot Resolutions demanding to know on what \"spot\" on US soil that blood was first spilt.  Congressional Globe, 30th Session (1848) pp.93-95  In January of 1848, he was among the 82 Whigs who defeated 81 Democrats in a procedural vote on an amendment to send a routine resolution back to committee with instructions to add the words \"a war unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the President of the United States.\" The amendment passed, but the bill never reemerged from committee and was never finally voted upon.  House Journal, 30th Session (1848) pp.183-184. Lincoln later damaged his political reputation with a speech in which he declared, \"God of Heaven has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent, and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men, women, and children, and lay waste and pillage the land of the just.\" Two weeks later, President Polk sent a peace treaty to Congress. While no one in Washington paid any attention to Lincoln, the Democrats orchestrated angry outbursts from across his district, where the war was popular and many had volunteered. In Morgan County, resolutions were adopted in fervent support of the war and in wrathful denunciation of the \"treasonable assaults of guerrillas at home; party demagogues; slanderers of the President; defenders of the butchery at the Alamo; traducers of the heroism at San Jacinto.\"  Abe Lincoln resource page. Warned by his law partner, William Herndon, that the damage was mounting and irreparable, Lincoln decided not to run for reelection. In fact, in 1848 he campaigned vigorously for Zachary Taylor, the successful general whose atrocities he had denounced in January. Regardless, his statements were not easily forgotten, and would haunt him during the Civil War. These statements were also held against him when he applied for a position in the new Taylor administration. Instead, Taylor's people offered Lincoln various positions in the remote Oregon Territory, primarily the governorship. Acceptance of this offer would have ended his career in the rapidly growing state of Illinois, so Lincoln declined the position. Returning to Springfield, Lincoln gave up politics for several years and turned his energies to his law practice. During this time, he made many trips on horseback between various counties' courthouses. Beveridge, (1928) 1: 428-33; Donald (1995) p. 140-43.. In the 1920s historical markers were placed at the county lines along the route Lincoln traveled in the eight judicial district. This example is on the border of Piatt and DeWitt counties. By the mid-1850s, Lincoln's caseload focused largely on the competing transportation interests of river barges and railroads. In one prominent 1851 case, he represented the Alton & Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with a shareholder, James A. Barret. Barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to the railroad on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. Lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest, that the newer route proposed by Alton & Sangamon was superior and less expensive, and that accordingly, the corporation had a right to sue Barret for his delinquent payment. He won this case, and the decision by the Illinois Supreme Court was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the United States. Donald, (1995) ch. 6.. Possibly the most notable criminal trial of Lincoln's career as a lawyer came in 1858, when he defended William \"Duff\" Armstrong, who has been charged with murder. The case became famous for Lincoln's use of judicial notice--a rare tactic at that time--to show that an eyewitness had lied on the stand. After the witness testified to having seen the crime by moonlight, Lincoln produced a Farmers' Almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle that it could not have provided enough illumination to see anything clearly. Based almost entirely on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted. Donald (1995), 150-51. Lincoln was involved in more than 5,100 cases in Illinois alone during his 23-year legal career. Though many of these cases involved little more than filing a writ, others were more substantial and quite involved. Lincoln and his partners appeared before the Illinois State Supreme Court more than 400 times. During one trial, Lincoln's voir dire included a question to prospective jurors as to whether they were acquainted with counsel for the other side. When a few of them turned out to know the other lawyer, the judge interrupted, saying, \"Mr. Lincoln, you are wasting the time of the court. The fact that a prospective juror knows your opponent does not disqualify him.\". \"No, Your Honor, I understand that,\" Lincoln answered. \"I'm afraid that some of them might not know him, which would place me at a disadvantage.\". Lincoln returned to politics in response to the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854), which expressly repealed the limits on slavery's extent as determined by the Missouri Compromise (1820). Illinois Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, the most powerful man in the Senate, proposed popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse, and incorporated it into the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory, rather than have such a decision imposed on them by Congress.  Donald, (1995) ch. 7.. In a speech against the act, on October 16 1854, delivered in Peoria, Lincoln first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day:. Drawing on remnants of the old Whig, Free Soil, Liberty and Democratic parties, he was instrumental in forming the new Republican Party. In a stirring campaign, the Republicans carried Illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. Lincoln was the obvious choice, but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an ex-Democrat Lyman Trumbull.. In 1857-58, Douglas broke with President Buchanan, leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state. Accepting the Republican nomination for Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered his famous speech: \"'A house divided against itself cannot stand.'(Mark 3:25) I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.\"  A House Divided Against Itself Cannot Stand, June 1858  The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the north.. The 1858 campaign featured the Lincoln-Douglas debates, a nationally famous contest on slavery. Lincoln warned that the \"Slave Power\" was threatening the values of republicanism, while Douglas emphasized the supremacy of democracy, as set forth in his Freeport Doctrine, which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not. Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature reelected Douglas to the Senate. Nevertheless, Lincoln's eloquence transformed him into a national political star.. During the debates of 1858, the issue of race was often discussed. During a time period when few believed in racial egalitarianism, Stephen Douglas informed the crowds, \"If you desire Negro citizenship… if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves… then support Mr. Lincoln and the Black Republican party, who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro.\"  First Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Ottawa, Illinois, August 21, 1858  Lincoln countered that he was \"not in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races.\"  Fourth Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Charleston, Illinois, September 18, 1858  His opposition to slavery was opposition to the Slave Power, though this would change during the course of the Civil War. Donald, (1995) ch. 8.. On May 9-10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur. At this convention, Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.. \"The Rail Candidate,\" Lincoln's 1860 candidacy is held up by slavery issue (slave on left) and party organization (New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley on right). Photo of Lincoln taken February 27, 1860 in New York City by Mathew Brady, the day of his famous Cooper Union speech.. Entering the presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog, Lincoln was eventually chosen as the Republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. His expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase. His \"Western\" origins also appealed to the newer states: other contenders, especially those with more governmental experience, had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states, while Lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the West. Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government. Yet despite his Southern connections (his in-laws owned slaves), Lincoln misunderstood the depth of the revolution underway in the South and the emergence of Southern nationalism. Throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war, and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession.  Gabor S. Boritt, \"'And the War Came'? Abraham Lincoln and the Question of Individual Responsibility,\" Why the Civil War Came ed by Boritt (1996), pp 3-30.. Throughout the election, Lincoln did not campaign or give speeches. This was handled by the state and county Republican organizations, who used the latest techniques to sustain party enthusiasm and thus obtain high turnout. There was little effort to convert non-Republicans, and there was virtually no campaigning in the South except for a few border cities such as St. Louis, Missouri, and Wheeling, Virginia; indeed, the party did not even run a slate in most of the South. In the North, there were thousands of Republican speakers, tons of campaign posters and leaflets, and thousands of newspaper editorials. These focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, making the most of his boyhood poverty, his pioneer background, his native genius, and his rise from obscurity. His nicknames, \"Honest Abe\" and \"the Rail-Splitter,\" were exploited to the full. The goal was to emphasize the superior power of \"free labor,\" whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts.  Thomas (1952) p 216; Reinhard H. Luthin, The First Lincoln Campaign (1944); Nevins vol 4;. On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, John C. Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and John Bell of the new Constitutional Union Party. He was the first Republican president, winning entirely on the strength of his support in the North: he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the South, and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other Southern states. Lincoln gained 1,865,908 votes (39.9% of the total), for 180 electoral votes; Douglas, 1,380,202 (29.5%) for 12 electoral votes; Breckenridge, 848,019 (18.1%) for 72 electoral votes; and Bell, 590,901 (12.5%) for 39 electoral votes. There were fusion tickets in some states, but even if his opponents had combined in every state, Lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election.. As Lincoln's election became more likely, secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the Union. South Carolina took the lead, followed by six other cotton-growing states in the deep South. The upper South (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to and rejected the secessionist appeal. They decided to stay in the Union, though they warned Lincoln that they would not support an invasion through their territory. The seven Confederate states seceded before Lincoln took office, declaring themselves to be a new nation, the Confederate States of America. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy.. President-elect Lincoln evaded possible assassins in Baltimore, and on February 23, 1861, arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C. At his inauguration on March 4, 1861, the German American Turners formed Lincoln's bodyguard; and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present, ready to protect the capital from Confederate invasion and local insurrection.. Photograph showing the March 4, 1861, inauguration of Abraham Lincoln in front of United States Capitol.. In his First Inaugural Address, Lincoln declared, \"I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments,\" arguing further that the purpose of the United States Constitution was \"to form a more perfect union\" than the Articles of Confederation which were explicitly perpetual, thus the Constitution too was perpetual. He asked rhetorically that even were the Constitution a simple contract, would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?. Also in his inaugural address, in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war, Lincoln supported the pending Corwin Amendment to the Constitution, which had already passed Congress. This amendment, which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it existed, was designed to appeal not to the Confederacy but to the critical border states. At the same time, Lincoln adamantly opposed the Crittenden Compromise, which would have permitted slavery in the territories. Despite support for the Crittenden compromise among some prominent Republicans (including William Seward), Lincoln denounced it saying that it \"would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people, tribe, and state owning a foot of land between here and Tierra del Fuego.\". By the time Lincoln took office, the Confederacy was an established fact, and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. No compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. Lincoln might have allowed the southern states to secede, and some Republicans recommended that. However, conservative Democratic nationalists, such as Jeremiah S. Black, Joseph Holt, and Edwin M. Stanton had taken control of Buchanan's cabinet around January 1, 1861, and refused to accept secession. Lincoln and nearly every Republican leader adopted this position by March 1861: the Union could not be dismantled. However, as a strict follower of the constitution, Lincoln refused to take any action against the South unless the Unionists themselves were attacked first. This finally happened in April 1861.. Historian Allan Nevins argues that Lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the Union, hold government property, and still avoid war. He \"temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis,\" overestimated the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South and border states, and misunderstood the conditional support of Unionists in the border states.  Allan Nevins, The Improvised War, 1861-1862 (1959) p 29. In April 1861, after Union troops at Fort Sumter were fired upon and forced to surrender, Lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and \"preserve the Union,\" which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. Virginia, which had repeatedly warned Lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state, responded by seceding, along with North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas.. The slave states of Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware did not secede, and Lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there, promising not to interfere with slavery. After the fighting started, he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas (especially in Maryland) and held in military prisons without trial. Over 18,000 were arrested, though none were executed. One, Clement Vallandigham, was exiled; but all of the remainder were released, usually after two or three months (see: Ex parte Merryman).. Lincoln met with his cabinet for the first reading of the Emancipation Proclamation draft on July 22, 1862. L-R: Edwin M. Stanton, Salmon P. Chase, Abraham Lincoln, Gideon Welles, Caleb B. Smith, William H. Seward, Montgomery Blair and Edward Bates. In July 1862, Congress moved to free the slaves by passing the Second Confiscation Act. The goal was to weaken the rebellion, which was led and controlled by slave owners. While it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery (the Thirteenth Amendment did that), the Act showed that Lincoln had the support of Congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. This new law was implemented with Lincoln's \"Emancipation Proclamation.\". Lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the United States. In 1861 – 1862, however, he made it clear that the North was fighting the war to preserve the Union, not to abolish slavery. Freeing the slaves became, in late 1862, a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. Abolitionists criticized Lincoln for his sluggishness over slavery per se, but on August 22, 1862, Lincoln explained:. The Emancipation Proclamation, announced on September 22 and put into effect on January 1, 1863, freed slaves in territories not under Union control. As Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all of them in Confederate hands (over three million) were freed. Lincoln later said: \"I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.\" The proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. Lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation. Lincoln addressed the issue of his consistency in an 1864 letter to Albert G. Hodges.  Letter to Albert G. Hodges, April 4, 1864. In September 1862, thirteen northern governors met in Altoona, Pennsylvania, at the Loyal War Governors' Conference to discuss the Proclamation and Union war effort. In the end, the state executives fully supported the president's Proclamation and also suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union's Army of the Potomac.  Images of America: Altoona, by Sr. Anne Francis Pulling, 2001, 10.. For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. As Frederick Douglass observed, Lincoln was, \"The first great man that I talked with in the United States freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself, of the difference of color.\" Life and Times of Frederick Douglass, by Frederick Douglass, 1895. After Union victories at Gettysburg, Vicksburg and Chattanooga in 1863, victory seemed at hand, and Lincoln promoted Ulysses S. Grant General-in-Chief ( March 12, 1864). When the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates, Lincoln supported Grant's strategy of wearing down Lee's Confederate army at the cost of heavy Union casualties. With an election looming, he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. At the Convention, the Republican Party selected Andrew Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. They ran on the new Union Party ticket uniting Republicans and War Democrats.. Lincoln, in top hat, with Allan Pinkerton and Gen. John Alexander McClernand at Antietam.. Nevertheless, Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Acknowledging this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would nonetheless defeat the Confederacy by an all-out military effort before turning over the White House: Mark Grimsley and Brooks D Simpson, eds. The Collapse of the Confederacy (2001) p 80. Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.. While the Democratic platform followed the Peace wing of the party and called the war a \"failure,\" their candidate, General George B. McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform.. Lincoln provided Grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to support Grant and win local support for the war effort. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September ended defeatist jitters; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln; the Union party was united and energized, and Lincoln was easily reelected in a landslide. He won all but two states, capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.. On March 4 1865, Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address, his favorite of all his speeches. At this time, a victory over the rebels was at hand, slavery was dead, and Lincoln was looking to the future.. “Running the ‘Machine’”. An 1864 cartoon featuring Lincoln, William Fessenden, Edwin Stanton, William Seward and Gideon Welles takes a swing at the Lincoln administration. The war was a source of constant frustration for the president, and occupied nearly all of his time. He had a contentious relationship with General McClellan, who became general-in-chief of all the Union armies in the wake of the embarrassing Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run and after the retirement of Winfield Scott in late 1861. Despite his inexperience in military affairs, Lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. His priorities were twofold: to ensure that Washington, D.C., was well defended; and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the Northern public and press. McClellan, a youthful West Point graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service, took a more cautious approach. He took several months to plan and execute his Peninsula Campaign, with the objective of capturing Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula between the James and York Rivers. McClellan's delay irritated Lincoln, as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend Washington, D.C. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops to defend the capital, a decision McClellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.. McClellan, a lifelong Democrat who was temperamentally conservative, was relieved as general-in-chief after releasing his Harrison's Landing Letter, where he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint John Pope, a Republican, as head of the new Army of Virginia. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack. But Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. In response to his failure, Pope was sent to Minnesota to fight the Sioux.. An 1864 Mathew Brady photo depicts President Lincoln reading a book with his youngest son, Tad. Panicked by Lee's invasion of Maryland, Lincoln restored McClellan to command of all forces around Washington in time for the Battle of Antietam (September 1862). The ensuing Union victory enabled Lincoln to release his Emancipation Proclamation, but he relieved McClellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed Republican Ambrose Burnside to head the Army of the Potomac. Burnside had promised to follow through on Lincoln's strategic vision for a strong offensive against Lee and Richmond. After Burnside was stunningly defeated at Fredericksburg, Joseph Hooker was given the command, despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders.  Joseph Hooker biography  Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville (May 1863), and relieved of command early in the subsequent Gettysburg Campaign replaced by George Meade.. After the Union victory at Gettysburg, Meade's failure to pursue Lee and months of inactivity for the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to bring in a western general, Ulysses S. Grant. Grant already had a solid string of victories in the Western Theater, including the battles of Vicksburg and Chattanooga. Responding to criticism of Grant, Lincoln was quoted as saying, \"I cannot spare this man. He fights.\" Grant waged his bloody Overland Campaign in 1864 with a strategy of a war of attrition, characterized by high Union losses at battles such as the Wilderness and Cold Harbor, but by proportionately higher Confederate losses. His invasion campaign eventually bottled Lee up in the Siege of Petersburg, so that Grant could take Richmond, and bring the war to a close in the spring of 1865.. Lincoln authorized Grant to target civilians and infrastructure, hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. This allowed Generals Sherman and Sheridan to destroy farms and towns in the Shenandoah Valley, Georgia, and South Carolina. The damage caused by Sherman's March to the Sea through Georgia totaled in excess of $100 million by Sherman's own estimate. See Hofstadter, Richard, The United States: The History of a Republic, Prentice-Hall, 1967, p. 446.. Lincoln had a star-crossed record as a military leader, possessing a keen understanding of strategic points (such as the Mississippi River and the fortress city of Vicksburg) and the importance of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing cities. He had, however, limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863, when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in Ulysses S. Grant. Only then could he insist on using African American troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.. Throughout the war, Lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. He spent hours at the War Department telegraph office, reading dispatches from his generals. He visited battle sites frequently, and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. During Jubal Anderson Early's raid on Washington, D.C. in 1864, Lincoln had to be told to duck to avoid being shot while observing the battle.. Reconstruction began during the war as Lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the Southern states and what to do with Confederate leaders and the freed slaves. Lincoln led the \"moderates\" regarding Reconstructionist policy, and was usually opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Thaddeus Stevens in the House and Charles Sumner and Benjamin Wade in the Senate (though he cooperated with these men on most other issues). Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind Union lines. His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.  /ref> Critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. Of special importance were Tennessee, where Lincoln appointed Andrew Johnson as governor, and Louisiana, where Lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. The Radicals thought this policy too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864. When Lincoln pocket-vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.  Donald (1995) ch. 20. On April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House in Virginia, and the war was effectively over. The other rebel armies surrendered soon after, and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare. Lincoln went to Richmond to make a public gesture of sitting at Jefferson Davis's own desk, symbolically saying to the nation that the President of the United States held authority over the entire land. He was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves, whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer's quote, \"I know I am free for I have seen the face of Father Abraham and have felt him.\" When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, Lincoln replied, \"Let 'em up easy.\"  Donald (1995) 576, 580,   \"President Lincoln Enters Richmond, 1865\" EyeWitness to History, www.eywitnesstohistory.com (2000).. One of the last photographs of Lincoln, likely taken between February and April 1865. Lincoln's powerful rhetoric defined the issues of the war for the nation, the world, and posterity. His extraordinary command of the English language was evidenced in the Gettysburg Address, a speech dedicating the cemetery at Gettysburg that he delivered on November 19, 1863. The speech defied Lincoln's own prediction that \"the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here.\" Lincoln's second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted. In these speeches, Lincoln articulated better than anyone else the rationale behind the Union cause.. In recent years, historians have stressed Lincoln's use of and redefinition of republican values. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln shifted emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism.  Jaffa (2000) p. 399  The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, rather than the Constitution's tolerance of slavers, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.\"  John Patrick Diggins, The Lost Soul of American Politics: Virtue, Self-interest, and the Foundations of Liberalism (1986) p. 307.  His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.  Foner (1970) p. 215 says, \"Lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism.\"  See also McPherson (1992) pp.61-64.  Nevertheless, in 1861 Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a \"republican form of government\" in every state. Jaffa (2000) p. 263  That duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in Reconstruction.. Lincoln's second inauguration on March 4, 1865. In the photo, Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth, can be seen in the crowd at the top and accomplices David Herold, Lewis Powell, George Atzerodt, John Surratt and Edmund Spangler in the bottom crowd. In his Gettysburg Address Lincoln redefined the American nation, arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776, \"conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\" He declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality, \"that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\" By emphasizing the centrality of the nation, he rebuffed the claims of state sovereignty. While some critics say Lincoln moved too far and too fast,  H.L. Mencken said \"It is difficult to imagine anything more untrue. The Union soldiers in the battle actually fought against self-determination; it was the Confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves.\" Mencken did not mention the right of self-determination rights for blacks.   they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked \"a new founding of the nation.\"  Wills (1992) p. 39.. During the Civil War, Lincoln appropriated powers no previous President had wielded: he used his war powers to proclaim a blockade, suspended the writ of habeas corpus, spent money without congressional authorization, and imprisoned 18,000 suspected Confederate sympathizers without trial. Nearly all of his actions, although vehemently denounced by the Copperheads, were subsequently upheld by Congress and the Courts.. Lincoln believed in the Whig theory of the presidency, which left Congress to write the laws while he signed them, vetoing only those bills that threatened his war powers. Thus, he signed the Homestead Act in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in 1869. Other important legislation involved economic matters, including the first income tax and higher tariffs. Also included was the creation of the system of national banks by the National Banking Acts of 1863, 1864, and 1865, which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system.  Congress created and Lincoln approved the Department of Agriculture in 1862, although that institution would not become a Cabinet-level department until 1889.. The Legal Tender Act of 1862 established the United States Note, the first paper currency in United States history.  This was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.. During the war, Lincoln's Treasury Department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied South—the most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.. In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope, to put down the \"Sioux Uprising\" in Minnesota. Presented with 303 death warrants for convicted Santee Dakota who had massacred innocent farmers, Lincoln affirmed 39 of these for execution (one was later reprieved).. The assassination of Abraham Lincoln. From left to right: Henry Rathbone, Clara Harris, Mary Todd Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth. Originally, John Wilkes Booth, a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland, had formulated a plan to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and determined to assassinate the president. Harrison, Lowell Hayes, Lincoln of Kentucky, University Press of Kentucky, 2000, pp. 3–4. ISBN 0813121566.  Learning that the President and First Lady, together with the Grants, would be attending Ford's Theatre, he laid his plans, assigning his co-conspirators to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward.. Without his main bodyguard Ward Hill Lamon, to whom he related his famous dream regarding his own assassination, Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14, 1865. As a lone bodyguard wandered, and Lincoln sat in his state box (Box 7) in the balcony, Booth crept up behind the President and waited for the funniest line of the play, hoping the laughter would muffle the noise of the gunshot. When the laughter began, Booth jumped into the box and aimed a single-shot, round-slug .44 caliber Henry Deringer at his head, firing at point-blank range. Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth but was cut by Booth's knife. Booth then leapt to the stage and shouted \"Sic semper tyrannis!\" (Latin: \"Thus always to tyrants\") and escaped, despite a broken leg suffered in the leap. George Alfred Townsend, The Life, Crime and Capture of John Wilkes Booth. New York: Dick & Fitzgerald, 1865. (LCCN  12002580.  A twelve-day manhunt ensued, in which Booth was chased by Federal agents (under the direction of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton). He was eventually cornered in a Virginia barn house  and shot, dying of his wounds soon after.. An army surgeon, Doctor Charles Leale, initially assessed Lincoln's wound as mortal. The President was taken across the street from the theater to the Petersen House, where he lay in a coma for nine hours before he died. Several physicians attended Lincoln, including U.S. Army Surgeon General Joseph K. Barnes of the Army Medical Museum. Using a probe, Barnes located some fragments of Lincoln's skull and the ball lodged 6 inches (15 cm) inside his brain. Lincoln never regained consciousness and was officially pronounced dead at 7:22:10 a.m. April 15, 1865 at the age of 56. There is some disagreement among historians as to Stanton's words after Lincoln died. All agree that he began \"Now he belongs to the...\" with some stating he said \"ages\" while others believe he said \"angels.\"  After Lincoln's body was returned to the White House, his body was prepared for his lying in repose in the East Room. He was the first president to lie in state.. The Army Medical Museum, now named the National Museum of Health and Medicine, has retained in its collection several artifacts relating to the assassination. Currently on display are the bullet that was fired from the Derringer pistol, the probe used by Barnes, pieces of Lincoln's skull and hair, and the surgeon's cuff stained with Lincoln's blood.. Lincoln's funeral train carried his remains, as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son William, 1,654 miles (2,661 km) to Illinois . Lincoln's body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to Illinois.  While much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the United States, Copperheads celebrated the death of a man they considered an unconstitutional tyrant. The Lincoln Tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, is 177 feet (54 m) tall and, by 1874, was surmounted with several bronze statues of Lincoln. To prevent repeated attempts to steal Lincoln's body and hold it for ransom, Robert Todd Lincoln had Lincoln exhumed and reinterred in concrete several feet thick in 1901.. With over 120 photographs taken of him, Lincoln was the most photographed man in the United States up to the time he was assassinated.. Lincoln was known for appointing political rivals to high positions in his cabinet to keep in line all factions of his party — and to let them battle each other and not combine against Lincoln. Historians agree that except for Simon Cameron, it was a highly effective group.. Abraham Lincoln's official White House portrait. Lincoln appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States:. In March 1860 in a speech in New Haven, Connecticut, Lincoln said, with respect to slavery, “Whenever this question shall be settled, it must be settled on some philosophical basis. No policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained.\" The philosophical basis for Lincoln’s beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that Lincoln be examined \"seriously as a man of ideas.\" Lincoln was a strong supporter of the American Whig version of liberal capitalism who, more than most politicians of the time, was able to express his ideas within the context of Nineteenth Century religious beliefs. Guelzo pg. 18-19. There were few people who strongly or directly influenced Lincoln’s moral and intellectual development and perspectives. There was no teacher, mentor, church leader, community leader, or peer that Lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. Lacking a formal education, Lincoln’s personal philosophy was shaped by \"an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning.\" It was Lincoln’s reading, rather than his relationships, that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs. Guelzo pg. 20. Miller pg. 57-59  Lincoln’s reading and study of the Bible was an integral part of his intellectual roots.. Lincoln did, even as a boy, largely reject organized religion, but the Calvinistic \"doctrine of necessity\" would remain a factor throughout his life. In 1846 Lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as \"that the human mind is impelled to action, or held in rest by some power, over which the mind itself has no control.\" Donald pg. 15. The quote came from a letter to the public in which Lincoln was denying charges by a political opponent that he was a “religious scoffer.”  In April 1864, in justifying his actions in regard to Emancipation, Lincoln wrote, \"I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of three years struggle the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. God alone can claim it.\" Donald pg. 514. As Lincoln matured, and especially during his term as president, the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. On a personal level, the death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace. Wilson pg. 251-254  After Willie’s death, in the summer or early fall of 1862, Lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary:. Lincoln’s religious skepticism was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the Lockean Enlightenment and classical liberalism, especially economic liberalism. Guelzo pg. 20  Consistent with the common practice of the Whig party, Lincoln would often use the Declaration of Independence as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies. Guelzo pg.194  In a February 22, 1861 speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia Lincoln said,. He found in the Declaration justification for Whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the nativist platform of the Know Nothings. In claiming that all men were created free, Lincoln and the Whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement, expanded education, territory to grow, and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population. Guelzo pg.194-195. It was the Declaration of Independence, rather than the Bible, that Lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. He saw the Declaration as more than a political document. To him, as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders, it was, foremost, a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation. Miller pg. 297. While Lincoln is usually portrayed bearded, he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year-old Grace Bedell. Lincoln's death made the President a martyr to many. Repeated polls of historians have ranked Lincoln as among the greatest presidents in U.S. history, often appearing in the first position. Among contemporary admirers, Lincoln is usually seen as personifying classical values of honesty and integrity, as well as respect for individual and minority rights, and human freedom in general.. Many American organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image, with interests ranging from the gay rights-supporting Log Cabin Republicans to the insurance corporation Lincoln National Corporation. The Lincoln automobile is also named after him. The ballistic missile submarine Abraham Lincoln (SSBN-602) and the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) were named in his honor. Also, the Liberty ship, SS Nancy Hanks was named to honor his mother. During the Spanish Civil War the American faction of the International Brigades named themselves the Abraham Lincoln Brigade after Lincoln.. Lincoln has been memorialized in many city names, notably the capital of Nebraska. Lincoln, Illinois, is the only city to be named for Abraham Lincoln before he became President. Lincoln's name and image appear in numerous places. These include the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., the U.S. Lincoln $5 bill and the Lincoln cent, Lincoln's sculpture on the Mount Rushmore, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois. In addition, New Salem, Illinois (a reconstruction of Lincoln's early adult hometown), Ford's Theatre, and Petersen House (where he died) are all preserved as museums. The Lincoln Shrine in Redlands, California, is located behind the A.K. Smiley Public Library. The state nickname for Illinois is Land of Lincoln.. Counties in 19 U.S. states (Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) are named after Lincoln.. Abraham Lincoln's birthday, February 12, was formerly a national holiday, now commemorated as Presidents' Day. However, it is still observed in Illinois and many other states as a separate legal holiday, Lincoln's Birthday. A dozen states have legal holidays celebrating the third Monday in February as 'Presidents' Day' as a combination Washington-Lincoln Day.. To commemorate his upcoming 200th birthday in February 2009, Congress established the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission (ALBC) in 2000. Dedicated to renewing American appreciation of Lincoln’s legacy, the 15-member commission is made up of lawmakers and scholars and also features an adivsory board of over 130 various Lincoln historians and enthusiasts. Located at Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., the ALBC is the organizing force behind numerous tributes, programs and cultural events highlighting a two-year celebration scheduled to begin in February 2008 at Lincoln’s birthplace:  Hodgenville, Kentucky.. Lincoln's birthplace and family home are national historic memorials: the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site in Hodgenville, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois.

              "4     Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the sixteenth President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1861 until his assassination. As an outspoken opponent of the expansion of slavery in the United States, \"[I]n his short autobiography written for the 1860 presidential campaign, Lincoln would describe his protest in the Illinois legislature as one that 'briefly defined his position on the slavery question, and so far as it goes, it was then the same that it is now.\" This was in reference to the anti-expansion sentiments he had then expressed. Doris Kearns Goodwin, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln (2005) p. 91.  Holzer pg. 232.  Writing of the Cooper Union  speech, Holzer notes, \"Cooper Union proved a unique confluence of political culture, rhetorical opportunity, technological innovation, and human genius, and it brought Abraham Lincoln to the center stage of American politics at precisely the right time and place, and with precisely the right message: that slavery was wrong, and ought to be confined to the areas where it already existed, and placed on the 'course of ultimate extinction... .'\"  Lincoln won the Republican Party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year. During his term, he helped preserve the United States by leading the defeat of the secessionist Confederate States of America in the American Civil War. He introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery, issuing his Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1865.. Lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including Ulysses S. Grant. Historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the Republican Party well, bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. Lincoln successfully defused a war scare with the United Kingdom in 1861. Under his leadership, the Union took control of the border slave states at the start of the war. Additionally, he managed his own reelection in the 1864 presidential election.. Opponents of the war (also known as \"Copperheads\") criticized him for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans, an abolitionist faction of the Republican Party, criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. Even with these problems, Lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches; his Gettysburg Address is but one example of this. At the close of the war, Lincoln held a moderate view of Reconstruction, seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. His assassination in 1865 was the first presidential assassination in U.S. history and made him a martyr for the ideal of national unity.. Scholars now rank Lincoln among the top three U.S. Presidents, with the majority of those surveyed placing him first. He is noted for his lasting influence on U.S. politics, including a redefinition of republicanism.  As Diggins explains, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.\" John Patrick Diggins, The Lost Soul of American Politics: Virtue, Self-interest, and the Foundations of Liberalism (1986) p. 307. Foner (1970) p. 215 noted that, \"Lincoln stressed the moral basis of Republicanism.\" Jaffa (2000) p. 399, stresses Lincoln's emphasis on the Declaration of Independence as what Lincoln called the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism. See also McPherson (1992) pp.61-64.. Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, to Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks, two uneducated farmers. Lincoln was born in a one-room log cabin on the   Sinking Spring Farm, in southeast Hardin County, Kentucky (now part of LaRue County). This area was at the time considered the \"frontier.\" The name \"Abraham\" was chosen to commemorate his grandfather, who was killed in an American Indian raid in 1786. Donald (1995) p 21  His elder sister, Sarah Lincoln, was born in 1807; a younger brother, Thomas Jr, died in infancy. It is sometimes debated whether Lincoln had Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of the connective tissue characterized by long limbs and great physical stature.  Marfan syndrome: Introduction Aug 1, 2006. Symbolic log cabin at Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site.. For some time, Thomas Lincoln was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the Kentucky back country. He had purchased the Sinking Spring Farm in December of 1808 for $200 cash and assumption of a debt.  The farm site is now preserved as part of Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site.  The family belonged to a Baptist church that had seceded from a larger church over the issue of slavery. Though Lincoln was exposed to his parents' anti-slavery sentiment from a very young age, he never joined their church, or any other church for that matter.  As a youth he had little use for religion. Life of Abraham Lincoln, Colonel Ward H. Lamon, 1872 - portions reprinted in  Chapter VIII: Abraham Lincoln, Deist, and Admirer of Thomas Paine, From the book Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents by Franklin Steiner (1936). Lincoln was just seven years old when, in 1816, the family was forced to make a new start in Perry County (now in Spencer County), Indiana. He later noted that this move was \"partly on account of slavery,\" and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in Kentucky: Unlike land in the Northwest Territory, Kentucky never had a proper U.S. survey, and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property. Lincoln was only nine when his mother, then thirty-four years old, died of milk sickness. Soon afterwards, his father remarried  to Sarah Bush Johnston. Sarah Lincoln raised young Lincoln like one of her own children. Years later she compared Lincoln to her own son, saying \"Both were good boys, but I must say — both now being dead that Abe was the best boy I ever saw or ever expect to see.\" Lincoln was affectionate toward his stepmother, whom he would call \"Mother\" for the rest of his life, but he was distant from his father.  Donald, (1995) pp. 28, 152.. In 1830, after more economic and land-title difficulties in Indiana, the family settled on public land  /ref> in Macon County, Illinois. Some scholars believe that it was his father's repeated land-title difficulties and ensuing financial hardships that led young Lincoln to study law.  The following winter was desolate and especially brutal, and the family considered moving back to Indiana. The following year, when his father relocated the family to a new homestead in Coles County, Illinois, twenty-two-year-old Lincoln struck out on his own, canoeing down the Sangamon River to the village of New Salem in Sangamon County. Later that year, hired by New Salem businessman Denton Offutt and accompanied by friends, he took goods from New Salem to New Orleans via flatboat on the Sangamon, Illinois and Mississippi rivers. While in New Orleans, he may have witnessed a slave auction, though as a frequent visitor to Kentucky, he would have had several earlier opportunities to witness  similar sales.  Donald, (1995) ch. 2.. Lincoln's formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling. Largely self-educated, he read every book he could get his hands on, once walking.  just to borrow one  While his favorite book was The Life of George Washington, Lincoln mastered the Bible, Shakespeare, and English and American history, and developed a plain writing style that puzzled audiences more used to grandiose rhetoric. He was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an ax; some rails he had allegedly split in his youth were exhibited at the 1860 Republican National Convention, as the party celebrated the poor-boy-made-good theme. Lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals, even for food. Though he was unusually tall at  , 4 inches and strong, Lincoln spent so much time reading that some neighbors suspected he must be doing it to avoid strenuous manual labor.. Young Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln began his political career in 1832, at age 23, with an unsuccessful campaign for the Illinois General Assembly, as a member of the Whig Party.  He ran eighth in a field of 13 candidates.  The centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the Sangamon River. He believed that this would attract steamboat traffic, which would allow the sparsely populated, poorer areas along the river to flourish.. He was elected captain of an Illinois militia company drawn from New Salem during the Black Hawk War, and later wrote that he had not had \"any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction.\"  Thomas (1952) 32-34; Basler (1946) p. 551   Though he never saw combat, Lincoln did assist in burying the dead from the Battle of Stillman's Run the day after Major Isaiah Stillman's troops fled the field of battle.  Abraham Lincoln Online Retrieved on March 11, 2007. For several months, Lincoln ran a small store in New Salem, selling tea, coffee, sugar, salt, blue calico, brown muslin, straw hats and whiskey.  Beveridge (1928) 1:127-8  Later, he found work as village postmaster and as a surveyor.. In 1834, he won election to the state legislature, and after coming across the Commentaries on the Laws of England, began to teach himself law. Admitted to the bar in 1837, he moved to Springfield, Illinois, that same year and began to practice law with John T. Stuart. With a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and in his closing arguments, Lincoln became one of the most respected and successful lawyers in Illinois and grew steadily more prosperous.. He served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a representative from Sangamon County, and became a leader of the Illinois Whig party. In 1837, he made his first protest against slavery in the Illinois House, stating that the institution was \"founded on both injustice and bad policy.\"  Protest in Illinois Legislature on Slavery, p.75, March 3, 1837  It was also in this same year that Lincoln met Joshua Fry Speed, who would become his most intimate friend.. Lincoln wrote a series of anonymous letters, published in 1842 in the Sangamon Journal, mocking State Auditor and prominent Democrat James Shields. Shields would later become a U.S. senator, but when he learned that it was Lincoln who had been writing the barbs, he challenged him to a duel. As Shields was the challenger, Lincoln was granted the right to choose the weapon and specified \"Cavalry broad swords of the largest size.\" Much taller and with long arms, this gave him an overwhelming advantage over his opponent; however, the duel was called off at the last minute. Beveridge (1928) 1:349. Lincoln had been practicing with the broad sword.  Two years later, Lincoln entered law practice with William Herndon, a fellow Whig. In 1854, both men joined the fledgling Republican Party. Following Lincoln's death, Herndon began collecting stories about Lincoln and published them in Herndon's Lincoln.. The first photograph ever taken of Mary Lincoln, a daguerreotype by Shepherd in 1846.. On November 4 1842 Lincoln married Mary Todd, daughter of a prominent slave-owning family from Kentucky. The couple had four sons. Robert Todd Lincoln was born in Springfield, Illinois on 1 August, 1843. Their only child to survive into adulthood, young Robert attended Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard College. Robert died on July 26, 1926, in Manchester, Vermont.. The other Lincoln children were born in Springfield, Illinois, and died either during childhood or their teen years. Edward Baker Lincoln was born on March 10, 1846, and died on 1 February, 1850, also in Springfield. William Wallace Lincoln was born on December 21, 1850, and died on February 20, 1862 in Washington, D.C., during Pres. Lincoln's first term. Thomas \"Tad\" Lincoln was born on 4 April, 1853, and died on July 16, 1871 in Chicago.. Four of his wife's brothers fought for the Confederacy, with one wounded and another killed in action. Lieutenant David H. Todd, a half-brother of Mary Todd Lincoln, served as commandant of the Libby Prison camp during the war.. The first photograph ever taken of Abraham Lincoln, a daguerreotype taken by Shepherd in 1846.. A Whig and an admirer of party leader Henry Clay,  Lincoln was elected to a term in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1846. As a freshman House member, he was not a particularly powerful or influential figure. He spoke out against the Mexican-American War, which he attributed to President Polk's desire for \"military glory — that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood.\" He also challenged the President's claims regarding the Texas boundary and offered Spot Resolutions demanding to know on what \"spot\" on US soil that blood was first spilt.  Congressional Globe, 30th Session (1848) pp.93-95  In January of 1848, he was among the 82 Whigs who defeated 81 Democrats in a procedural vote on an amendment to send a routine resolution back to committee with instructions to add the words \"a war unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the President of the United States.\" The amendment passed, but the bill never reemerged from committee and was never finally voted upon.  House Journal, 30th Session (1848) pp.183-184. Lincoln later damaged his political reputation with a speech in which he declared, \"God of Heaven has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent, and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men, women, and children, and lay waste and pillage the land of the just.\" Two weeks later, President Polk sent a peace treaty to Congress. While no one in Washington paid any attention to Lincoln, the Democrats orchestrated angry outbursts from across his district, where the war was popular and many had volunteered. In Morgan County, resolutions were adopted in fervent support of the war and in wrathful denunciation of the \"treasonable assaults of guerrillas at home; party demagogues; slanderers of the President; defenders of the butchery at the Alamo; traducers of the heroism at San Jacinto.\"  Abe Lincoln resource page. Warned by his law partner, William Herndon, that the damage was mounting and irreparable, Lincoln decided not to run for reelection. In fact, in 1848 he campaigned vigorously for Zachary Taylor, the successful general whose atrocities he had denounced in January. Regardless, his statements were not easily forgotten, and would haunt him during the Civil War. These statements were also held against him when he applied for a position in the new Taylor administration. Instead, Taylor's people offered Lincoln various positions in the remote Oregon Territory, primarily the governorship. Acceptance of this offer would have ended his career in the rapidly growing state of Illinois, so Lincoln declined the position. Returning to Springfield, Lincoln gave up politics for several years and turned his energies to his law practice. During this time, he made many trips on horseback between various counties' courthouses. Beveridge, (1928) 1: 428-33; Donald (1995) p. 140-43.. In the 1920s historical markers were placed at the county lines along the route Lincoln traveled in the eight judicial district. This example is on the border of Piatt and DeWitt counties. By the mid-1850s, Lincoln's caseload focused largely on the competing transportation interests of river barges and railroads. In one prominent 1851 case, he represented the Alton & Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with a shareholder, James A. Barret. Barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to the railroad on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. Lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest, that the newer route proposed by Alton & Sangamon was superior and less expensive, and that accordingly, the corporation had a right to sue Barret for his delinquent payment. He won this case, and the decision by the Illinois Supreme Court was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the United States. Donald, (1995) ch. 6.. Possibly the most notable criminal trial of Lincoln's career as a lawyer came in 1858, when he defended William \"Duff\" Armstrong, who has been charged with murder. The case became famous for Lincoln's use of judicial notice--a rare tactic at that time--to show that an eyewitness had lied on the stand. After the witness testified to having seen the crime by moonlight, Lincoln produced a Farmers' Almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle that it could not have provided enough illumination to see anything clearly. Based almost entirely on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted. Donald (1995), 150-51. Lincoln was involved in more than 5,100 cases in Illinois alone during his 23-year legal career. Though many of these cases involved little more than filing a writ, others were more substantial and quite involved. Lincoln and his partners appeared before the Illinois State Supreme Court more than 400 times. During one trial, Lincoln's voir dire included a question to prospective jurors as to whether they were acquainted with counsel for the other side. When a few of them turned out to know the other lawyer, the judge interrupted, saying, \"Mr. Lincoln, you are wasting the time of the court. The fact that a prospective juror knows your opponent does not disqualify him.\". \"No, Your Honor, I understand that,\" Lincoln answered. \"I'm afraid that some of them might not know him, which would place me at a disadvantage.\". Lincoln returned to politics in response to the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854), which expressly repealed the limits on slavery's extent as determined by the Missouri Compromise (1820). Illinois Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, the most powerful man in the Senate, proposed popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse, and incorporated it into the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory, rather than have such a decision imposed on them by Congress.  Donald, (1995) ch. 7.. In a speech against the act, on October 16 1854, delivered in Peoria, Lincoln first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day:. Drawing on remnants of the old Whig, Free Soil, Liberty and Democratic parties, he was instrumental in forming the new Republican Party. In a stirring campaign, the Republicans carried Illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. Lincoln was the obvious choice, but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an ex-Democrat Lyman Trumbull.. In 1857-58, Douglas broke with President Buchanan, leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state. Accepting the Republican nomination for Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered his famous speech: \"'A house divided against itself cannot stand.'(Mark 3:25) I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.\"  A House Divided Against Itself Cannot Stand, June 1858  The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the north.. The 1858 campaign featured the Lincoln-Douglas debates, a nationally famous contest on slavery. Lincoln warned that the \"Slave Power\" was threatening the values of republicanism, while Douglas emphasized the supremacy of democracy, as set forth in his Freeport Doctrine, which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not. Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature reelected Douglas to the Senate. Nevertheless, Lincoln's eloquence transformed him into a national political star.. During the debates of 1858, the issue of race was often discussed. During a time period when few believed in racial egalitarianism, Stephen Douglas informed the crowds, \"If you desire Negro citizenship… if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves… then support Mr. Lincoln and the Black Republican party, who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro.\"  First Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Ottawa, Illinois, August 21, 1858  Lincoln countered that he was \"not in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races.\"  Fourth Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Charleston, Illinois, September 18, 1858  His opposition to slavery was opposition to the Slave Power, though this would change during the course of the Civil War. Donald, (1995) ch. 8.. On May 9-10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur. At this convention, Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.. \"The Rail Candidate,\" Lincoln's 1860 candidacy is held up by slavery issue (slave on left) and party organization (New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley on right). Photo of Lincoln taken February 27, 1860 in New York City by Mathew Brady, the day of his famous Cooper Union speech.. Entering the presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog, Lincoln was eventually chosen as the Republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. His expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase. His \"Western\" origins also appealed to the newer states: other contenders, especially those with more governmental experience, had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states, while Lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the West. Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government. Yet despite his Southern connections (his in-laws owned slaves), Lincoln misunderstood the depth of the revolution underway in the South and the emergence of Southern nationalism. Throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war, and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession.  Gabor S. Boritt, \"'And the War Came'? Abraham Lincoln and the Question of Individual Responsibility,\" Why the Civil War Came ed by Boritt (1996), pp 3-30.. Throughout the election, Lincoln did not campaign or give speeches. This was handled by the state and county Republican organizations, who used the latest techniques to sustain party enthusiasm and thus obtain high turnout. There was little effort to convert non-Republicans, and there was virtually no campaigning in the South except for a few border cities such as St. Louis, Missouri, and Wheeling, Virginia; indeed, the party did not even run a slate in most of the South. In the North, there were thousands of Republican speakers, tons of campaign posters and leaflets, and thousands of newspaper editorials. These focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, making the most of his boyhood poverty, his pioneer background, his native genius, and his rise from obscurity. His nicknames, \"Honest Abe\" and \"the Rail-Splitter,\" were exploited to the full. The goal was to emphasize the superior power of \"free labor,\" whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts.  Thomas (1952) p 216; Reinhard H. Luthin, The First Lincoln Campaign (1944); Nevins vol 4;. On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, John C. Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and John Bell of the new Constitutional Union Party. He was the first Republican president, winning entirely on the strength of his support in the North: he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the South, and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other Southern states. Lincoln gained 1,865,908 votes (39.9% of the total), for 180 electoral votes; Douglas, 1,380,202 (29.5%) for 12 electoral votes; Breckenridge, 848,019 (18.1%) for 72 electoral votes; and Bell, 590,901 (12.5%) for 39 electoral votes. There were fusion tickets in some states, but even if his opponents had combined in every state, Lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election.. As Lincoln's election became more likely, secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the Union. South Carolina took the lead, followed by six other cotton-growing states in the deep South. The upper South (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to and rejected the secessionist appeal. They decided to stay in the Union, though they warned Lincoln that they would not support an invasion through their territory. The seven Confederate states seceded before Lincoln took office, declaring themselves to be a new nation, the Confederate States of America. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy.. President-elect Lincoln evaded possible assassins in Baltimore, and on February 23, 1861, arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C. At his inauguration on March 4, 1861, the German American Turners formed Lincoln's bodyguard; and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present, ready to protect the capital from Confederate invasion and local insurrection.. Photograph showing the March 4, 1861, inauguration of Abraham Lincoln in front of United States Capitol.. In his First Inaugural Address, Lincoln declared, \"I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments,\" arguing further that the purpose of the United States Constitution was \"to form a more perfect union\" than the Articles of Confederation which were explicitly perpetual, thus the Constitution too was perpetual. He asked rhetorically that even were the Constitution a simple contract, would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?. Also in his inaugural address, in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war, Lincoln supported the pending Corwin Amendment to the Constitution, which had already passed Congress. This amendment, which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it existed, was designed to appeal not to the Confederacy but to the critical border states. At the same time, Lincoln adamantly opposed the Crittenden Compromise, which would have permitted slavery in the territories. Despite support for the Crittenden compromise among some prominent Republicans (including William Seward), Lincoln denounced it saying that it \"would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people, tribe, and state owning a foot of land between here and Tierra del Fuego.\". By the time Lincoln took office, the Confederacy was an established fact, and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. No compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. Lincoln might have allowed the southern states to secede, and some Republicans recommended that. However, conservative Democratic nationalists, such as Jeremiah S. Black, Joseph Holt, and Edwin M. Stanton had taken control of Buchanan's cabinet around January 1, 1861, and refused to accept secession. Lincoln and nearly every Republican leader adopted this position by March 1861: the Union could not be dismantled. However, as a strict follower of the constitution, Lincoln refused to take any action against the South unless the Unionists themselves were attacked first. This finally happened in April 1861.. Historian Allan Nevins argues that Lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the Union, hold government property, and still avoid war. He \"temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis,\" overestimated the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South and border states, and misunderstood the conditional support of Unionists in the border states.  Allan Nevins, The Improvised War, 1861-1862 (1959) p 29. In April 1861, after Union troops at Fort Sumter were fired upon and forced to surrender, Lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and \"preserve the Union,\" which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. Virginia, which had repeatedly warned Lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state, responded by seceding, along with North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas.. The slave states of Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware did not secede, and Lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there, promising not to interfere with slavery. After the fighting started, he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas (especially in Maryland) and held in military prisons without trial. Over 18,000 were arrested, though none were executed. One, Clement Vallandigham, was exiled; but all of the remainder were released, usually after two or three months (see: Ex parte Merryman).. Lincoln met with his cabinet for the first reading of the Emancipation Proclamation draft on July 22, 1862. L-R: Edwin M. Stanton, Salmon P. Chase, Abraham Lincoln, Gideon Welles, Caleb B. Smith, William H. Seward, Montgomery Blair and Edward Bates. In July 1862, Congress moved to free the slaves by passing the Second Confiscation Act. The goal was to weaken the rebellion, which was led and controlled by slave owners. While it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery (the Thirteenth Amendment did that), the Act showed that Lincoln had the support of Congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. This new law was implemented with Lincoln's \"Emancipation Proclamation.\". Lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the United States. In 1861 – 1862, however, he made it clear that the North was fighting the war to preserve the Union, not to abolish slavery. Freeing the slaves became, in late 1862, a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. Abolitionists criticized Lincoln for his sluggishness over slavery per se, but on August 22, 1862, Lincoln explained:. The Emancipation Proclamation, announced on September 22 and put into effect on January 1, 1863, freed slaves in territories not under Union control. As Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all of them in Confederate hands (over three million) were freed. Lincoln later said: \"I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.\" The proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. Lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation. Lincoln addressed the issue of his consistency in an 1864 letter to Albert G. Hodges.  Letter to Albert G. Hodges, April 4, 1864. In September 1862, thirteen northern governors met in Altoona, Pennsylvania, at the Loyal War Governors' Conference to discuss the Proclamation and Union war effort. In the end, the state executives fully supported the president's Proclamation and also suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union's Army of the Potomac.  Images of America: Altoona, by Sr. Anne Francis Pulling, 2001, 10.. For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. As Frederick Douglass observed, Lincoln was, \"The first great man that I talked with in the United States freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself, of the difference of color.\" Life and Times of Frederick Douglass, by Frederick Douglass, 1895. After Union victories at Gettysburg, Vicksburg and Chattanooga in 1863, victory seemed at hand, and Lincoln promoted Ulysses S. Grant General-in-Chief ( March 12, 1864). When the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates, Lincoln supported Grant's strategy of wearing down Lee's Confederate army at the cost of heavy Union casualties. With an election looming, he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. At the Convention, the Republican Party selected Andrew Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. They ran on the new Union Party ticket uniting Republicans and War Democrats.. Lincoln, in top hat, with Allan Pinkerton and Gen. John Alexander McClernand at Antietam.. Nevertheless, Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Acknowledging this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would nonetheless defeat the Confederacy by an all-out military effort before turning over the White House: Mark Grimsley and Brooks D Simpson, eds. The Collapse of the Confederacy (2001) p 80. Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.. While the Democratic platform followed the Peace wing of the party and called the war a \"failure,\" their candidate, General George B. McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform.. Lincoln provided Grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to support Grant and win local support for the war effort. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September ended defeatist jitters; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln; the Union party was united and energized, and Lincoln was easily reelected in a landslide. He won all but two states, capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.. On March 4 1865, Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address, his favorite of all his speeches. At this time, a victory over the rebels was at hand, slavery was dead, and Lincoln was looking to the future.. “Running the ‘Machine’”. An 1864 cartoon featuring Lincoln, William Fessenden, Edwin Stanton, William Seward and Gideon Welles takes a swing at the Lincoln administration. The war was a source of constant frustration for the president, and occupied nearly all of his time. He had a contentious relationship with General McClellan, who became general-in-chief of all the Union armies in the wake of the embarrassing Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run and after the retirement of Winfield Scott in late 1861. Despite his inexperience in military affairs, Lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. His priorities were twofold: to ensure that Washington, D.C., was well defended; and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the Northern public and press. McClellan, a youthful West Point graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service, took a more cautious approach. He took several months to plan and execute his Peninsula Campaign, with the objective of capturing Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula between the James and York Rivers. McClellan's delay irritated Lincoln, as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend Washington, D.C. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops to defend the capital, a decision McClellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.. McClellan, a lifelong Democrat who was temperamentally conservative, was relieved as general-in-chief after releasing his Harrison's Landing Letter, where he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint John Pope, a Republican, as head of the new Army of Virginia. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack. But Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. In response to his failure, Pope was sent to Minnesota to fight the Sioux.. An 1864 Mathew Brady photo depicts President Lincoln reading a book with his youngest son, Tad. Panicked by Lee's invasion of Maryland, Lincoln restored McClellan to command of all forces around Washington in time for the Battle of Antietam (September 1862). The ensuing Union victory enabled Lincoln to release his Emancipation Proclamation, but he relieved McClellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed Republican Ambrose Burnside to head the Army of the Potomac. Burnside had promised to follow through on Lincoln's strategic vision for a strong offensive against Lee and Richmond. After Burnside was stunningly defeated at Fredericksburg, Joseph Hooker was given the command, despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders.  Joseph Hooker biography  Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville (May 1863), and relieved of command early in the subsequent Gettysburg Campaign replaced by George Meade.. After the Union victory at Gettysburg, Meade's failure to pursue Lee and months of inactivity for the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to bring in a western general, Ulysses S. Grant. Grant already had a solid string of victories in the Western Theater, including the battles of Vicksburg and Chattanooga. Responding to criticism of Grant, Lincoln was quoted as saying, \"I cannot spare this man. He fights.\" Grant waged his bloody Overland Campaign in 1864 with a strategy of a war of attrition, characterized by high Union losses at battles such as the Wilderness and Cold Harbor, but by proportionately higher Confederate losses. His invasion campaign eventually bottled Lee up in the Siege of Petersburg, so that Grant could take Richmond, and bring the war to a close in the spring of 1865.. Lincoln authorized Grant to target civilians and infrastructure, hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. This allowed Generals Sherman and Sheridan to destroy farms and towns in the Shenandoah Valley, Georgia, and South Carolina. The damage caused by Sherman's March to the Sea through Georgia totaled in excess of $100 million by Sherman's own estimate. See Hofstadter, Richard, The United States: The History of a Republic, Prentice-Hall, 1967, p. 446.. Lincoln had a star-crossed record as a military leader, possessing a keen understanding of strategic points (such as the Mississippi River and the fortress city of Vicksburg) and the importance of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing cities. He had, however, limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863, when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in Ulysses S. Grant. Only then could he insist on using African American troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.. Throughout the war, Lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. He spent hours at the War Department telegraph office, reading dispatches from his generals. He visited battle sites frequently, and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. During Jubal Anderson Early's raid on Washington, D.C. in 1864, Lincoln had to be told to duck to avoid being shot while observing the battle.. Reconstruction began during the war as Lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the Southern states and what to do with Confederate leaders and the freed slaves. Lincoln led the \"moderates\" regarding Reconstructionist policy, and was usually opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Thaddeus Stevens in the House and Charles Sumner and Benjamin Wade in the Senate (though he cooperated with these men on most other issues). Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind Union lines. His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.  /ref> Critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. Of special importance were Tennessee, where Lincoln appointed Andrew Johnson as governor, and Louisiana, where Lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. The Radicals thought this policy too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864. When Lincoln pocket-vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.  Donald (1995) ch. 20. On April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House in Virginia, and the war was effectively over. The other rebel armies surrendered soon after, and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare. Lincoln went to Richmond to make a public gesture of sitting at Jefferson Davis's own desk, symbolically saying to the nation that the President of the United States held authority over the entire land. He was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves, whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer's quote, \"I know I am free for I have seen the face of Father Abraham and have felt him.\" When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, Lincoln replied, \"Let 'em up easy.\"  Donald (1995) 576, 580,   \"President Lincoln Enters Richmond, 1865\" EyeWitness to History, www.eywitnesstohistory.com (2000).. One of the last photographs of Lincoln, likely taken between February and April 1865. Lincoln's powerful rhetoric defined the issues of the war for the nation, the world, and posterity. His extraordinary command of the English language was evidenced in the Gettysburg Address, a speech dedicating the cemetery at Gettysburg that he delivered on November 19, 1863. The speech defied Lincoln's own prediction that \"the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here.\" Lincoln's second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted. In these speeches, Lincoln articulated better than anyone else the rationale behind the Union cause.. In recent years, historians have stressed Lincoln's use of and redefinition of republican values. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln shifted emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism.  Jaffa (2000) p. 399  The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, rather than the Constitution's tolerance of slavers, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.\"  John Patrick Diggins, The Lost Soul of American Politics: Virtue, Self-interest, and the Foundations of Liberalism (1986) p. 307.  His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.  Foner (1970) p. 215 says, \"Lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism.\"  See also McPherson (1992) pp.61-64.  Nevertheless, in 1861 Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a \"republican form of government\" in every state. Jaffa (2000) p. 263  That duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in Reconstruction.. Lincoln's second inauguration on March 4, 1865. In the photo, Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth, can be seen in the crowd at the top and accomplices David Herold, Lewis Powell, George Atzerodt, John Surratt and Edmund Spangler in the bottom crowd. In his Gettysburg Address Lincoln redefined the American nation, arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776, \"conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\" He declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality, \"that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\" By emphasizing the centrality of the nation, he rebuffed the claims of state sovereignty. While some critics say Lincoln moved too far and too fast,  H.L. Mencken said \"It is difficult to imagine anything more untrue. The Union soldiers in the battle actually fought against self-determination; it was the Confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves.\" Mencken did not mention the right of self-determination rights for blacks.   they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked \"a new founding of the nation.\"  Wills (1992) p. 39.. During the Civil War, Lincoln appropriated powers no previous President had wielded: he used his war powers to proclaim a blockade, suspended the writ of habeas corpus, spent money without congressional authorization, and imprisoned 18,000 suspected Confederate sympathizers without trial. Nearly all of his actions, although vehemently denounced by the Copperheads, were subsequently upheld by Congress and the Courts.. Lincoln believed in the Whig theory of the presidency, which left Congress to write the laws while he signed them, vetoing only those bills that threatened his war powers. Thus, he signed the Homestead Act in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in 1869. Other important legislation involved economic matters, including the first income tax and higher tariffs. Also included was the creation of the system of national banks by the National Banking Acts of 1863, 1864, and 1865, which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system.  Congress created and Lincoln approved the Department of Agriculture in 1862, although that institution would not become a Cabinet-level department until 1889.. The Legal Tender Act of 1862 established the United States Note, the first paper currency in United States history.  This was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.. During the war, Lincoln's Treasury Department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied South—the most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.. In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope, to put down the \"Sioux Uprising\" in Minnesota. Presented with 303 death warrants for convicted Santee Dakota who had massacred innocent farmers, Lincoln affirmed 39 of these for execution (one was later reprieved).. The assassination of Abraham Lincoln. From left to right: Henry Rathbone, Clara Harris, Mary Todd Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth. Originally, John Wilkes Booth, a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland, had formulated a plan to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and determined to assassinate the president. Harrison, Lowell Hayes, Lincoln of Kentucky, University Press of Kentucky, 2000, pp. 3–4. ISBN 0813121566.  Learning that the President and First Lady, together with the Grants, would be attending Ford's Theatre, he laid his plans, assigning his co-conspirators to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward.. Without his main bodyguard Ward Hill Lamon, to whom he related his famous dream regarding his own assassination, Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14, 1865. As a lone bodyguard wandered, and Lincoln sat in his state box (Box 7) in the balcony, Booth crept up behind the President and waited for the funniest line of the play, hoping the laughter would muffle the noise of the gunshot. When the laughter began, Booth jumped into the box and aimed a single-shot, round-slug .44 caliber Henry Deringer at his head, firing at point-blank range. Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth but was cut by Booth's knife. Booth then leapt to the stage and shouted \"Sic semper tyrannis!\" (Latin: \"Thus always to tyrants\") and escaped, despite a broken leg suffered in the leap. George Alfred Townsend, The Life, Crime and Capture of John Wilkes Booth. New York: Dick & Fitzgerald, 1865. (LCCN  12002580.  A twelve-day manhunt ensued, in which Booth was chased by Federal agents (under the direction of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton). He was eventually cornered in a Virginia barn house  and shot, dying of his wounds soon after.. An army surgeon, Doctor Charles Leale, initially assessed Lincoln's wound as mortal. The President was taken across the street from the theater to the Petersen House, where he lay in a coma for nine hours before he died. Several physicians attended Lincoln, including U.S. Army Surgeon General Joseph K. Barnes of the Army Medical Museum. Using a probe, Barnes located some fragments of Lincoln's skull and the ball lodged 6 inches (15 cm) inside his brain. Lincoln never regained consciousness and was officially pronounced dead at 7:22:10 a.m. April 15, 1865 at the age of 56. There is some disagreement among historians as to Stanton's words after Lincoln died. All agree that he began \"Now he belongs to the...\" with some stating he said \"ages\" while others believe he said \"angels.\"  After Lincoln's body was returned to the White House, his body was prepared for his lying in repose in the East Room. He was the first president to lie in state.. The Army Medical Museum, now named the National Museum of Health and Medicine, has retained in its collection several artifacts relating to the assassination. Currently on display are the bullet that was fired from the Derringer pistol, the probe used by Barnes, pieces of Lincoln's skull and hair, and the surgeon's cuff stained with Lincoln's blood.. Lincoln's funeral train carried his remains, as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son William, 1,654 miles (2,661 km) to Illinois . Lincoln's body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to Illinois.  While much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the United States, Copperheads celebrated the death of a man they considered an unconstitutional tyrant. The Lincoln Tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, is 177 feet (54 m) tall and, by 1874, was surmounted with several bronze statues of Lincoln. To prevent repeated attempts to steal Lincoln's body and hold it for ransom, Robert Todd Lincoln had Lincoln exhumed and reinterred in concrete several feet thick in 1901.. With over 120 photographs taken of him, Lincoln was the most photographed man in the United States up to the time he was assassinated.. Lincoln was known for appointing political rivals to high positions in his cabinet to keep in line all factions of his party — and to let them battle each other and not combine against Lincoln. Historians agree that except for Simon Cameron, it was a highly effective group.. Abraham Lincoln's official White House portrait. Lincoln appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States:. In March 1860 in a speech in New Haven, Connecticut, Lincoln said, with respect to slavery, “Whenever this question shall be settled, it must be settled on some philosophical basis. No policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained.\" The philosophical basis for Lincoln’s beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that Lincoln be examined \"seriously as a man of ideas.\" Lincoln was a strong supporter of the American Whig version of liberal capitalism who, more than most politicians of the time, was able to express his ideas within the context of Nineteenth Century religious beliefs. Guelzo pg. 18-19. There were few people who strongly or directly influenced Lincoln’s moral and intellectual development and perspectives. There was no teacher, mentor, church leader, community leader, or peer that Lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. Lacking a formal education, Lincoln’s personal philosophy was shaped by \"an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning.\" It was Lincoln’s reading, rather than his relationships, that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs. Guelzo pg. 20. Miller pg. 57-59  Lincoln’s reading and study of the Bible was an integral part of his intellectual roots.. Lincoln did, even as a boy, largely reject organized religion, but the Calvinistic \"doctrine of necessity\" would remain a factor throughout his life. In 1846 Lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as \"that the human mind is impelled to action, or held in rest by some power, over which the mind itself has no control.\" Donald pg. 15. The quote came from a letter to the public in which Lincoln was denying charges by a political opponent that he was a “religious scoffer.”  In April 1864, in justifying his actions in regard to Emancipation, Lincoln wrote, \"I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of three years struggle the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. God alone can claim it.\" Donald pg. 514. As Lincoln matured, and especially during his term as president, the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. On a personal level, the death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace. Wilson pg. 251-254  After Willie’s death, in the summer or early fall of 1862, Lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary:. Lincoln’s religious skepticism was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the Lockean Enlightenment and classical liberalism, especially economic liberalism. Guelzo pg. 20  Consistent with the common practice of the Whig party, Lincoln would often use the Declaration of Independence as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies. Guelzo pg.194  In a February 22, 1861 speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia Lincoln said,. He found in the Declaration justification for Whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the nativist platform of the Know Nothings. In claiming that all men were created free, Lincoln and the Whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement, expanded education, territory to grow, and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population. Guelzo pg.194-195. It was the Declaration of Independence, rather than the Bible, that Lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. He saw the Declaration as more than a political document. To him, as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders, it was, foremost, a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation. Miller pg. 297. While Lincoln is usually portrayed bearded, he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year-old Grace Bedell. Lincoln's death made the President a martyr to many. Repeated polls of historians have ranked Lincoln as among the greatest presidents in U.S. history, often appearing in the first position. Among contemporary admirers, Lincoln is usually seen as personifying classical values of honesty and integrity, as well as respect for individual and minority rights, and human freedom in general.. Many American organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image, with interests ranging from the gay rights-supporting Log Cabin Republicans to the insurance corporation Lincoln National Corporation. The Lincoln automobile is also named after him. The ballistic missile submarine Abraham Lincoln (SSBN-602) and the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) were named in his honor. Also, the Liberty ship, SS Nancy Hanks was named to honor his mother. During the Spanish Civil War the American faction of the International Brigades named themselves the Abraham Lincoln Brigade after Lincoln.. Lincoln has been memorialized in many city names, notably the capital of Nebraska. Lincoln, Illinois, is the only city to be named for Abraham Lincoln before he became President. Lincoln's name and image appear in numerous places. These include the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., the U.S. Lincoln $5 bill and the Lincoln cent, Lincoln's sculpture on the Mount Rushmore, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois. In addition, New Salem, Illinois (a reconstruction of Lincoln's early adult hometown), Ford's Theatre, and Petersen House (where he died) are all preserved as museums. The Lincoln Shrine in Redlands, California, is located behind the A.K. Smiley Public Library. The state nickname for Illinois is Land of Lincoln.. Counties in 19 U.S. states (Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) are named after Lincoln.. Abraham Lincoln's birthday, February 12, was formerly a national holiday, now commemorated as Presidents' Day. However, it is still observed in Illinois and many other states as a separate legal holiday, Lincoln's Birthday. A dozen states have legal holidays celebrating the third Monday in February as 'Presidents' Day' as a combination Washington-Lincoln Day.. To commemorate his upcoming 200th birthday in February 2009, Congress established the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission (ALBC) in 2000. Dedicated to renewing American appreciation of Lincoln’s legacy, the 15-member commission is made up of lawmakers and scholars and also features an adivsory board of over 130 various Lincoln historians and enthusiasts. Located at Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., the ALBC is the organizing force behind numerous tributes, programs and cultural events highlighting a two-year celebration scheduled to begin in February 2008 at Lincoln’s birthplace:  Hodgenville, Kentucky.. Lincoln's birthplace and family home are national historic memorials: the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site in Hodgenville, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois. The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum opened in Springfield in 2005; it is a major tourist attraction, with state-of-the-art exhibits.



Plains zebra. Grevy's zebra. Zebras are African equids best known for their distinctive white and black stripes. Their stripes come in different patterns unique to each individual. They are generally social animals and can be seen in small harems to large herds. In addition to their stripes, zebras have erect, mohawk-like manes. Unlike their closest relatives, horses and asses, zebras have never been truly domesticated.. There are three species of zebra: the Plains Zebra, Grévy's Zebra and the Mountain Zebra. The Plains zebra and the Mountain zebra belong to the subgenus Hippotigris, but Grevy's zebra is the sole species of subgenus Dolichohippus. The latter resembles an ass while the former two are more horse-like. Nevertheless, DNA and molecular data show that zebras do indeed have monophyletic origins. All three belong to the genus Equus along with other living equids. In certain regions of Kenya, Plains zebras and Grevy's zebras coexist.. The unique stripes and behaviors of zebras make these among the animals most familiar to people. They can be found in a variety of habitats, such as grasslands, savannas, woodlands, thorny scrublands, mountains and coastal hills. However, various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations, in particular hunting for skins and habitat destruction. Grevy's zebra and the Mountain zebra are endangered. While Plains zebras are much more plentiful, one subspecies, the quagga, went extinct in the late nineteenth century.. The name \"zebra\" comes from the Old Portuguese word zevra which means \"wild ass\". The pronunciation is     internationally, or     in North America.. Zebras were the second lineage to diverge from the earliest proto-horses, after the asses, around 4 million years ago. Grevy's zebra is believed to have been the first zebra species to emerge. The ancestors of the Equus horses are believed to have been striped, and zebras must have retained the stripes of their ancestors due to their advantage for social animals in tropical environments. Extensive stripes would be of little use to equids that live in low densities in deserts (like asses and some horses) or ones that live in colder climates with shaggy coats and annual shading (like some horses).   Fossils of an ancient equid were discovered in the Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument in Hagerman, Idaho. It was named the Hagerman horse with a scientific name of Equus simplicidens. It is believed to have been similar to the Grevy's zebra.   The animals had stocky zebra-like bodies and short, narrow, donkey-like skulls.    Grevy's zebra also has a donkey-like skull. The Hagerman horse is also called the American zebra or Hagerman zebra.. Zebras in Botswana. There are three extant species. Collectively, two of the species have 8 subspecies (7 extant). Zebra populations are diverse, and the relationships between and the taxonomic status of several of the subspecies are not well known.. * Genus: Equus. ** Subgenus: Hippotigris. *** Plains Zebra, Equus quagga. **** Quagga, Equus quagga quagga (extinct). **** Burchell's Zebra, Equus quagga burchellii (includes Damara Zebra). **** Grant's Zebra, Equus quagga boehmi. **** Selous' Zebra, Equus quagga borensis. **** Chapman's Zebra, Equus quagga chapmani. **** Crawshay's Zebra, Equus quagga crawshayi. *** Mountain Zebra, Equus zebra. **** Cape Mountain Zebra, Equus zebra zebra. **** Hartmann's Mountain Zebra, Equus zebra hartmannae. ** Subgenus: Dolichohippus. *** Grévy's Zebra, Equus grevyi. An albino zebra in captivity. The Plains Zebra (Equus quagga, formerly Equus burchelli) is the most common, and has or had about twelve subspecies distributed across much of southern and eastern Africa. It, or particular subspecies of it, have also been known as the Common Zebra, the Dauw, Burchell's Zebra (actually the subspecies Equus quagga burchellii), Chapman's Zebra, Wahlberg's Zebra, Selous' Zebra, Grant's Zebra, Boehm's Zebra and the Quagga (another extinct subspecies, Equus quagga quagga).. The Mountain Zebra (Equus zebra) of southwest Africa tends to have a sleek coat with a white belly and narrower stripes than the Plains Zebra. It has two subspecies and is classified as vulnerable.. Grévy's Zebra (Equus grevyi) is the largest type, with a long, narrow head making it appear rather mule-like. It is an inhabitant of the semi-arid grasslands of Ethiopia and northern Kenya. Grévy's Zebra is the rarest species of zebra around today, and is classified as endangered.. Although zebra species may have overlapping ranges, they do not interbreed. This held true even when the Quagga and Burchell's race of Plains Zebra shared the same area. In captivity, Plains Zebras have been crossed with Mountain zebras. The hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the Plains Zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern. Attempts to breed a Grévy's Zebra stallion to Mountain Zebra mares resulted in a high rate of miscarriage. In captivity, crosses between zebras and other (non-zebra) equines have produced several distinct hybrids, including the zebroid, zeedonk, zony, and zorse.. It was previously believed that zebras were white animals with black stripes since some zebras have white underbellies. However embryological evidence shows that the animal's background color is dark and the white stripes and bellies are additions.. A mother nursing her young blends into a stand of deadwood.. The stripes are typically vertical on the head, neck, forequarters, and main body, with horizontal stripes at the rear and on the legs of the animal. The \"zebra crossing\" is named after the zebra's black and white stripes.. It has been suggested that the stripes serve as visual cues and identification.  With each striping pattern unique to each individual, zebras can recognize one another by their stripes.. Others believe that the stripes act as a camouflage mechanism. This is accomplished in several ways. First, the vertical striping helps the zebra hide in grass. While seeming absurd at first glance considering that grass is neither white nor black, it is supposed to be effective against the zebra's main predator, the lion, which is color blind. Theoretically a zebra standing still in tall grass may not be noticed at all by a lion. Additionally, since zebras are herd animals, the stripes may help to confuse predators - a number of zebras standing or moving close together may appear as one large animal, making it more difficult for the lion to pick out any single zebra to attack.    A herd of zebras scattering to avoid a predator will also represent to that predator a confused mass of vertical stripes travelling in multiple directions making it difficult for the predator to track an individual visually as it separates from its herdmates, although biologists have never observed lions appearing confused by zebra stripes.. A more recent theory, supported by experiment, posits that the disruptive colouration is also an effective means of confusing the visual system of the blood-sucking tsetse fly. Waage, J. K. (1981). How the zebra got its stripes: biting flies as selective agents in the evolution of zebra colouration. J. Entom. Soc. South Africa. 44: 351 - 358.  Alternative theories include that the stripes coincide with fat patterning beneath the skin, serving as a thermoregulatory mechanism for the zebra, and that wounds sustained disrupt the striping pattern to clearly indicate the fitness of the animal to potential mates.. A zebra walking. Like horses, zebras walk, trot, canter and gallop. They are generally slower than horses but their great stamina helps them outpace predators. When chased, a zebra will zig-zag from side to side making it more difficult for the predator. When cornered the zebra will rear up and kick or bite its attacker.. Closeup of a zebra. Zebras have excellent eyesight. It is believed that they can see in color. Like most ungulates the zebra has its eyes on the sides of its head, giving it a wide field of view. Zebras also have night vision, although not as advanced as that of most of their predators, but their hearing compensates.. Zebras have great hearing, and tend to have larger, rounder ears than horses. Like horses and other ungulates, zebra can turn their ears in almost any direction. In addition to eyesight and hearing, zebras have an acute sense of smell and taste.. Zebras in Tanzania. Like most members of the horse family, zebras are highly sociable. Their social structure, however, depends on the species. Mountain zebras and Plains zebras live in groups, known as 'harems', consisting of one stallion with up to six mares and their foals. Bachelor males either live alone or with groups of other bachelors until they are old enough to challenge a breeding stallion. When attacked by packs of hyenas or wild dogs, a zebra group will huddle together with the foals in the middle while the stallion tries to ward them off.. Unlike the other zebra species, Grevy's zebras do not have permanent social bonds. A group of these zebras rarely stays together for more than a few months. The foals stay with their mother, while the adult male lives alone. However like the other two zebra species, bachelor male zebras will organize in groups.. Like horses, zebras sleep standing up and only sleep when neighbors are around to warn them of predators.. A zebra feeding on grass. Zebras communicate with each other with high pitched barks and whinnying. Grevy's zebras make mule-like brays. A zebra’s ears signify its mood. When a zebra is in a calm, tense or friendly mood, its ears stand erect. When it is frightened, its ears are pushed forward. When angry, the ears are pulled backward. When surveying an area for predators, zebras will stand in an alert posture; with ears erect, head held high, and staring. When tense they will also snort. When a predator is spotted or sensed, a zebra will bark (or bray) loudly.. Mother and foal at the Dallas Zoo. Zebras are very adaptable grazers. They feed mainly on grasses but will also eat shrubs, herbs, twigs, leaves and bark. Their well adapted digestive system allows them to subsist on diets of lower nutritional quality than that necessary for herbivores.. Like most animal species, female zebras mature earlier than the males and a mare may have her first foal by the age of three. Males are not able to breed until the age of five or six. Mares may give birth to one foal every twelve months. She nurses the foal for up to a year. Like horses, zebras are able to stand, walk and suckle shortly after they're born. A zebra foal is brown and white instead of black and white at birth.. Plains and Mountain zebra foals are protected by their mother as well as the head stallion and the other mares in their group. Grevy’s zebra foals have only their mother as a regular protector since, as noted above, Grevy's zebra groups often disband after a few months.. Lord Rothschild with his famed zebra carriage (Equus burchelli), which he frequently drove through London. Attempts have been made to train zebras for riding since they have better resistance than horses to African diseases. However most of these attempts failed, due to the zebra's more unpredictable nature and tendency to panic under stress. For this reason, zebra-mules or zebroids (crosses between any species of zebra and a horse, pony, donkey or ass) are preferred over pure-bred zebras.. In England, the zoological collector Lord Rothschild frequently used zebras to draw a carriage. In 1907, Rosendo Ribeiro, the first doctor in Nairobi, Kenya, used a riding zebra for house-calls. In the mid 1800s Governor George Grey imported zebras to New Zealand from his previous posting in South Africa, and used them to pull his carriage on his privately owned Kawau Island.. A tamed zebra being ridden in East Africa. Captain Horace Hayes, in \"Points of the Horse\" (circa 1893) compared the usefulness of different zebra species. In 1891, Hayes broke a mature, intact Mountain Zebra stallion to ride in two days time, and the animal was quiet enough for his wife to ride and be photographed upon. He found the Burchell's zebra easy to break in and considered it ideal for domestication, as it was immune to the bite of the tsetse fly. He considered the quagga well-suited to domestication due to being easy to train to saddle and harness. Hayes, Capt. Horace (1893),  Points of the Horse, pp. 311-316, London: W. Thacker. Modern man has had great impact on the zebra population. Zebras were, and still are, hunted mainly for their skins. The Cape mountain zebra was hunted to near extinction with less than 100 individuals by the 1930s. However the population has increased to about 700 due to conservation efforts. Both Mountain zebra subspecies are currently protected in national parks but are still endangered.. Zebras on the Botswana coat of arms. The Grevy's zebra is also endangered. Hunting and competition from livestock have greatly decreased their population. Because of the population's small size, environmental hazards, such as drought, are capable of easily affecting the entire species. Plains zebras are much more numerous and have a healthy population. Nevertheless they too are threatened by hunting and habitat change from farming. One subspecies, the quagga, is now extinct.. Zebras have been the subject of African folk tales which tell how they got their stripes. According to a Bushmen folk tale of Namibia, the zebra was once all white but got its black stripes after a fight with a baboon over a waterhole. After kicking the baboon so hard the zebra lost his balance and tripped over a fire and the fire sticks left scorches mark all over this white coat.    In the film Fantasia, two centaurs are depicted being half human and half zebra, instead of the typical half human and half horse.. Illustration of a zebra by Ludolphus. Zebra are a popular subject in art.    The fourth Mughal emperor Jahangir (r.1605-24), commissioned a painting of the zebra, which was completed by Ustad Mansur. Cohen, M.J. John Major, Simon Schama (2004),  History in Quotations:Reflecting 5000 Years of World History, p. 146, Sterling Publishing Company, Inc., ISBN 0304353876  Zebra stripes are also a popular style for furniture, carpets and fashion.. When in movies and cartoons zebras are most often miscellaneous characters but have had some starring roles, notably in Madagascar and Racing Stripes. Zebras are also serve as mascots and symbols for products and corporations, notably Zebra Technologies and Fruit Stripe gum.

Plains zebra. Grevy's zebra. Zebras are African equids best known for their distinctive white and black stripes. Their stripes come in different patterns unique to each individual. They are generally social animals and can be seen in small harems to large herds. In addition to their stripes, zebras have erect, mohawk-like manes. Unlike their closest relatives, horses and asses, zebras have never been truly domesticated.. There are three species of zebra: the Plains Zebra, Grévy's Zebra and the Mountain Zebra. The Plains zebra and the Mountain zebra belong to the subgenus Hippotigris, but Grevy's zebra is the sole species of subgenus Dolichohippus. The latter resembles an ass while the former two are more horse-like. Nevertheless, DNA and molecular data show that zebras do indeed have monophyletic origins. All three belong to the genus Equus along with other living equids. In certain regions of Kenya, Plains zebras and Grevy's zebras coexist.. The unique stripes and behaviors of zebras make these among the animals most familiar to people. They can be found in a variety of habitats, such as grasslands, savannas, woodlands, thorny scrublands, mountains and coastal hills. However, various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations, in particular hunting for skins and habitat destruction. Grevy's zebra and the Mountain zebra are endangered. While Plains zebras are much more plentiful, one subspecies, the quagga, went extinct in the late nineteenth century.. The name \"zebra\" comes from the Old Portuguese word zevra which means \"wild ass\". The pronunciation is     internationally, or     in North America.. Zebras were the second lineage to diverge from the earliest proto-horses, after the asses, around 4 million years ago. Grevy's zebra is believed to have been the first zebra species to emerge. The ancestors of the Equus horses are believed to have been striped, and zebras must have retained the stripes of their ancestors due to their advantage for social animals in tropical environments. Extensive stripes would be of little use to equids that live in low densities in deserts (like asses and some horses) or ones that live in colder climates with shaggy coats and annual shading (like some horses).   Fossils of an ancient equid were discovered in the Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument in Hagerman, Idaho. It was named the Hagerman horse with a scientific name of Equus simplicidens. It is believed to have been similar to the Grevy's zebra.   The animals had stocky zebra-like bodies and short, narrow, donkey-like skulls.    Grevy's zebra also has a donkey-like skull. The Hagerman horse is also called the American zebra or Hagerman zebra.. Zebras in Botswana. There are three extant species. Collectively, two of the species have 8 subspecies (7 extant). Zebra populations are diverse, and the relationships between and the taxonomic status of several of the subspecies are not well known.. * Genus: Equus. ** Subgenus: Hippotigris. *** Plains Zebra, Equus quagga. **** Quagga, Equus quagga quagga (extinct). **** Burchell's Zebra, Equus quagga burchellii (includes Damara Zebra). **** Grant's Zebra, Equus quagga boehmi. **** Selous' Zebra, Equus quagga borensis. **** Chapman's Zebra, Equus quagga chapmani. **** Crawshay's Zebra, Equus quagga crawshayi. *** Mountain Zebra, Equus zebra. **** Cape Mountain Zebra, Equus zebra zebra. **** Hartmann's Mountain Zebra, Equus zebra hartmannae. ** Subgenus: Dolichohippus. *** Grévy's Zebra, Equus grevyi. An albino zebra in captivity. The Plains Zebra (Equus quagga, formerly Equus burchelli) is the most common, and has or had about twelve subspecies distributed across much of southern and eastern Africa. It, or particular subspecies of it, have also been known as the Common Zebra, the Dauw, Burchell's Zebra (actually the subspecies Equus quagga burchellii), Chapman's Zebra, Wahlberg's Zebra, Selous' Zebra, Grant's Zebra, Boehm's Zebra and the Quagga (another extinct subspecies, Equus quagga quagga).. The Mountain Zebra (Equus zebra) of southwest Africa tends to have a sleek coat with a white belly and narrower stripes than the Plains Zebra. It has two subspecies and is classified as vulnerable.. Grévy's Zebra (Equus grevyi) is the largest type, with a long, narrow head making it appear rather mule-like. It is an inhabitant of the semi-arid grasslands of Ethiopia and northern Kenya. Grévy's Zebra is the rarest species of zebra around today, and is classified as endangered.. Although zebra species may have overlapping ranges, they do not interbreed. This held true even when the Quagga and Burchell's race of Plains Zebra shared the same area. In captivity, Plains Zebras have been crossed with Mountain zebras. The hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the Plains Zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern. Attempts to breed a Grévy's Zebra stallion to Mountain Zebra mares resulted in a high rate of miscarriage. In captivity, crosses between zebras and other (non-zebra) equines have produced several distinct hybrids, including the zebroid, zeedonk, zony, and zorse.. It was previously believed that zebras were white animals with black stripes since some zebras have white underbellies. However embryological evidence shows that the animal's background color is dark and the white stripes and bellies are additions.. A mother nursing her young blends into a stand of deadwood.. The stripes are typically vertical on the head, neck, forequarters, and main body, with horizontal stripes at the rear and on the legs of the animal. The \"zebra crossing\" is named after the zebra's black and white stripes.. It has been suggested that the stripes serve as visual cues and identification.  With each striping pattern unique to each individual, zebras can recognize one another by their stripes.. Others believe that the stripes act as a camouflage mechanism. This is accomplished in several ways. First, the vertical striping helps the zebra hide in grass. While seeming absurd at first glance considering that grass is neither white nor black, it is supposed to be effective against the zebra's main predator, the lion, which is color blind. Theoretically a zebra standing still in tall grass may not be noticed at all by a lion. Additionally, since zebras are herd animals, the stripes may help to confuse predators - a number of zebras standing or moving close together may appear as one large animal, making it more difficult for the lion to pick out any single zebra to attack.    A herd of zebras scattering to avoid a predator will also represent to that predator a confused mass of vertical stripes travelling in multiple directions making it difficult for the predator to track an individual visually as it separates from its herdmates, although biologists have never observed lions appearing confused by zebra stripes.. A more recent theory, supported by experiment, posits that the disruptive colouration is also an effective means of confusing the visual system of the blood-sucking tsetse fly. Waage, J. K. (1981). How the zebra got its stripes: biting flies as selective agents in the evolution of zebra colouration. J. Entom. Soc. South Africa. 44: 351 - 358.  Alternative theories include that the stripes coincide with fat patterning beneath the skin, serving as a thermoregulatory mechanism for the zebra, and that wounds sustained disrupt the striping pattern to clearly indicate the fitness of the animal to potential mates.. A zebra walking. Like horses, zebras walk, trot, canter and gallop. They are generally slower than horses but their great stamina helps them outpace predators. When chased, a zebra will zig-zag from side to side making it more difficult for the predator. When cornered the zebra will rear up and kick or bite its attacker.. Closeup of a zebra. Zebras have excellent eyesight. It is believed that they can see in color. Like most ungulates the zebra has its eyes on the sides of its head, giving it a wide field of view. Zebras also have night vision, although not as advanced as that of most of their predators, but their hearing compensates.. Zebras have great hearing, and tend to have larger, rounder ears than horses. Like horses and other ungulates, zebra can turn their ears in almost any direction. In addition to eyesight and hearing, zebras have an acute sense of smell and taste.. Zebras in Tanzania. Like most members of the horse family, zebras are highly sociable. Their social structure, however, depends on the species. Mountain zebras and Plains zebras live in groups, known as 'harems', consisting of one stallion with up to six mares and their foals. Bachelor males either live alone or with groups of other bachelors until they are old enough to challenge a breeding stallion. When attacked by packs of hyenas or wild dogs, a zebra group will huddle together with the foals in the middle while the stallion tries to ward them off.. Unlike the other zebra species, Grevy's zebras do not have permanent social bonds. A group of these zebras rarely stays together for more than a few months. The foals stay with their mother, while the adult male lives alone. However like the other two zebra species, bachelor male zebras will organize in groups.. Like horses, zebras sleep standing up and only sleep when neighbors are around to warn them of predators.. A zebra feeding on grass. Zebras communicate with each other with high pitched barks and whinnying. Grevy's zebras make mule-like brays. A zebra’s ears signify its mood. When a zebra is in a calm, tense or friendly mood, its ears stand erect. When it is frightened, its ears are pushed forward. When angry, the ears are pulled backward. When surveying an area for predators, zebras will stand in an alert posture; with ears erect, head held high, and staring. When tense they will also snort. When a predator is spotted or sensed, a zebra will bark (or bray) loudly.. Mother and foal at the Dallas Zoo. Zebras are very adaptable grazers. They feed mainly on grasses but will also eat shrubs, herbs, twigs, leaves and bark. Their well adapted digestive system allows them to subsist on diets of lower nutritional quality than that necessary for herbivores.. Like most animal species, female zebras mature earlier than the males and a mare may have her first foal by the age of three. Males are not able to breed until the age of five or six. Mares may give birth to one foal every twelve months. She nurses the foal for up to a year. Like horses, zebras are able to stand, walk and suckle shortly after they're born. A zebra foal is brown and white instead of black and white at birth.. Plains and Mountain zebra foals are protected by their mother as well as the head stallion and the other mares in their group. Grevy’s zebra foals have only their mother as a regular protector since, as noted above, Grevy's zebra groups often disband after a few months.. Lord Rothschild with his famed zebra carriage (Equus burchelli), which he frequently drove through London. Attempts have been made to train zebras for riding since they have better resistance than horses to African diseases. However most of these attempts failed, due to the zebra's more unpredictable nature and tendency to panic under stress. For this reason, zebra-mules or zebroids (crosses between any species of zebra and a horse, pony, donkey or ass) are preferred over pure-bred zebras.. In England, the zoological collector Lord Rothschild frequently used zebras to draw a carriage. In 1907, Rosendo Ribeiro, the first doctor in Nairobi, Kenya, used a riding zebra for house-calls. In the mid 1800s Governor George Grey imported zebras to New Zealand from his previous posting in South Africa, and used them to pull his carriage on his privately owned Kawau Island.. A tamed zebra being ridden in East Africa. Captain Horace Hayes, in \"Points of the Horse\" (circa 1893) compared the usefulness of different zebra species. In 1891, Hayes broke a mature, intact Mountain Zebra stallion to ride in two days time, and the animal was quiet enough for his wife to ride and be photographed upon. He found the Burchell's zebra easy to break in and considered it ideal for domestication, as it was immune to the bite of the tsetse fly. He considered the quagga well-suited to domestication due to being easy to train to saddle and harness. Hayes, Capt. Horace (1893),  Points of the Horse, pp. 311-316, London: W. Thacker. Modern man has had great impact on the zebra population. Zebras were, and still are, hunted mainly for their skins. The Cape mountain zebra was hunted to near extinction with less than 100 individuals by the 1930s. However the population has increased to about 700 due to conservation efforts. Both Mountain zebra subspecies are currently protected in national parks but are still endangered.. Zebras on the Botswana coat of arms. The Grevy's zebra is also endangered. Hunting and competition from livestock have greatly decreased their population. Because of the population's small size, environmental hazards, such as drought, are capable of easily affecting the entire species. Plains zebras are much more numerous and have a healthy population. Nevertheless they too are threatened by hunting and habitat change from farming. One subspecies, the quagga, is now extinct.. Zebras have been the subject of African folk tales which tell how they got their stripes. According to a Bushmen folk tale of Namibia, the zebra was once all white but got its black stripes after a fight with a baboon over a waterhole. After kicking the baboon so hard the zebra lost his balance and tripped over a fire and the fire sticks left scorches mark all over this white coat.    In the film Fantasia, two centaurs are depicted being half human and half zebra, instead of the typical half human and half horse.. Illustration of a zebra by Ludolphus.

When in movies and cartoons zebras are most often miscellaneous characters but have had some starring roles, notably in Madagascar and Racing Stripes. Zebras are also serve as mascots and symbols for products and corporations, notably Zebra Technologies and Fruit Stripe gum.

Plains zebra. Grevy's zebra. Zebras are African equids best known for their distinctive white and black stripes. Their stripes come in different patterns unique to each individual. They are generally social animals and can be seen in small harems to large herds. In addition to their stripes, zebras have erect, mohawk-like manes. Unlike their closest relatives, horses and asses, zebras have never been truly domesticated.. There are three species of zebra: the Plains Zebra, Grévy's Zebra and the Mountain Zebra. The Plains zebra and the Mountain zebra belong to the subgenus Hippotigris, but Grevy's zebra is the sole species of subgenus Dolichohippus. The latter resembles an ass while the former two are more horse-like. Nevertheless, DNA and molecular data show that zebras do indeed have monophyletic origins. All three belong to the genus Equus along with other living equids. In certain regions of Kenya, Plains zebras and Grevy's zebras coexist.. The unique stripes and behaviors of zebras make these among the animals most familiar to people. They can be found in a variety of habitats, such as grasslands, savannas, woodlands, thorny scrublands, mountains and coastal hills. However, various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations, in particular hunting for skins and habitat destruction. Grevy's zebra and the Mountain zebra are endangered. While Plains zebras are much more plentiful, one subspecies, the quagga, went extinct in the late nineteenth century.. The name \"zebra\" comes from the Old Portuguese word zevra which means \"wild ass\". The pronunciation is     internationally, or     in North America.. Zebras were the second lineage to diverge from the earliest proto-horses, after the asses, around 4 million years ago. Grevy's zebra is believed to have been the first zebra species to emerge. The ancestors of the Equus horses are believed to have been striped, and zebras must have retained the stripes of their ancestors due to their advantage for social animals in tropical environments. Extensive stripes would be of little use to equids that live in low densities in deserts (like asses and some horses) or ones that live in colder climates with shaggy coats and annual shading (like some horses).   Fossils of an ancient equid were discovered in the Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument in Hagerman, Idaho. It was named the Hagerman horse with a scientific name of Equus simplicidens. It is believed to have been similar to the Grevy's zebra.   The animals had stocky zebra-like bodies and short, narrow, donkey-like skulls.    Grevy's zebra also has a donkey-like skull. The Hagerman horse is also called the American zebra or Hagerman zebra.. Zebras in Botswana. There are three extant species. Collectively, two of the species have 8 subspecies (7 extant). Zebra populations are diverse, and the relationships between and the taxonomic status of several of the subspecies are not well known.. * Genus: Equus. ** Subgenus: Hippotigris. *** Plains Zebra, Equus quagga. **** Quagga, Equus quagga quagga (extinct). **** Burchell's Zebra, Equus quagga burchellii (includes Damara Zebra). **** Grant's Zebra, Equus quagga boehmi. **** Selous' Zebra, Equus quagga borensis. **** Chapman's Zebra, Equus quagga chapmani. **** Crawshay's Zebra, Equus quagga crawshayi. *** Mountain Zebra, Equus zebra. **** Cape Mountain Zebra, Equus zebra zebra. **** Hartmann's Mountain Zebra, Equus zebra hartmannae. ** Subgenus: Dolichohippus. *** Grévy's Zebra, Equus grevyi. An albino zebra in captivity. The Plains Zebra (Equus quagga, formerly Equus burchelli) is the most common, and has or had about twelve subspecies distributed across much of southern and eastern Africa. It, or particular subspecies of it, have also been known as the Common Zebra, the Dauw, Burchell's Zebra (actually the subspecies Equus quagga burchellii), Chapman's Zebra, Wahlberg's Zebra, Selous' Zebra, Grant's Zebra, Boehm's Zebra and the Quagga (another extinct subspecies, Equus quagga quagga).. The Mountain Zebra (Equus zebra) of southwest Africa tends to have a sleek coat with a white belly and narrower stripes than the Plains Zebra. It has two subspecies and is classified as vulnerable.. Grévy's Zebra (Equus grevyi) is the largest type, with a long, narrow head making it appear rather mule-like. It is an inhabitant of the semi-arid grasslands of Ethiopia and northern Kenya. Grévy's Zebra is the rarest species of zebra around today, and is classified as endangered.. Although zebra species may have overlapping ranges, they do not interbreed. This held true even when the Quagga and Burchell's race of Plains Zebra shared the same area. In captivity, Plains Zebras have been crossed with Mountain zebras. The hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the Plains Zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern. Attempts to breed a Grévy's Zebra stallion to Mountain Zebra mares resulted in a high rate of miscarriage. In captivity, crosses between zebras and other (non-zebra) equines have produced several distinct hybrids, including the zebroid, zeedonk, zony, and zorse.. It was previously believed that zebras were white animals with black stripes since some zebras have white underbellies. However embryological evidence shows that the animal's background color is dark and the white stripes and bellies are additions.. A mother nursing her young blends into a stand of deadwood.. The stripes are typically vertical on the head, neck, forequarters, and main body, with horizontal stripes at the rear and on the legs of the animal. The \"zebra crossing\" is named after the zebra's black and white stripes.. It has been suggested that the stripes serve as visual cues and identification.  With each striping pattern unique to each individual, zebras can recognize one another by their stripes.. Others believe that the stripes act as a camouflage mechanism. This is accomplished in several ways. First, the vertical striping helps the zebra hide in grass. While seeming absurd at first glance considering that grass is neither white nor black, it is supposed to be effective against the zebra's main predator, the lion, which is color blind. Theoretically a zebra standing still in tall grass may not be noticed at all by a lion. Additionally, since zebras are herd animals, the stripes may help to confuse predators - a number of zebras standing or moving close together may appear as one large animal, making it more difficult for the lion to pick out any single zebra to attack.    A herd of zebras scattering to avoid a predator will also represent to that predator a confused mass of vertical stripes travelling in multiple directions making it difficult for the predator to track an individual visually as it separates from its herdmates, although biologists have never observed lions appearing confused by zebra stripes.. A more recent theory, supported by experiment, posits that the disruptive colouration is also an effective means of confusing the visual system of the blood-sucking tsetse fly. Waage, J. K. (1981). How the zebra got its stripes: biting flies as selective agents in the evolution of zebra colouration. J. Entom. Soc. South Africa. 44: 351 - 358.  Alternative theories include that the stripes coincide with fat patterning beneath the skin, serving as a thermoregulatory mechanism for the zebra, and that wounds sustained disrupt the striping pattern to clearly indicate the fitness of the animal to potential mates.. A zebra walking. Like horses, zebras walk, trot, canter and gallop. They are generally slower than horses but their great stamina helps them outpace predators. When chased, a zebra will zig-zag from side to side making it more difficult for the predator. When cornered the zebra will rear up and kick or bite its attacker.. Closeup of a zebra. Zebras have excellent eyesight. It is believed that they can see in color. Like most ungulates the zebra has its eyes on the sides of its head, giving it a wide field of view. Zebras also have night vision, although not as advanced as that of most of their predators, but their hearing compensates.. Zebras have great hearing, and tend to have larger, rounder ears than horses. Like horses and other ungulates, zebra can turn their ears in almost any direction. In addition to eyesight and hearing, zebras have an acute sense of smell and taste.. Zebras in Tanzania. Like most members of the horse family, zebras are highly sociable. Their social structure, however, depends on the species. Mountain zebras and Plains zebras live in groups, known as 'harems', consisting of one stallion with up to six mares and their foals. Bachelor males either live alone or with groups of other bachelors until they are old enough to challenge a breeding stallion. When attacked by packs of hyenas or wild dogs, a zebra group will huddle together with the foals in the middle while the stallion tries to ward them off.. Unlike the other zebra species, Grevy's zebras do not have permanent social bonds. A group of these zebras rarely stays together for more than a few months. The foals stay with their mother, while the adult male lives alone. However like the other two zebra species, bachelor male zebras will organize in groups.. Like horses, zebras sleep standing up and only sleep when neighbors are around to warn them of predators.. A zebra feeding on grass. Zebras communicate with each other with high pitched barks and whinnying. Grevy's zebras make mule-like brays. A zebra’s ears signify its mood. When a zebra is in a calm, tense or friendly mood, its ears stand erect. When it is frightened, its ears are pushed forward. When angry, the ears are pulled backward. When surveying an area for predators, zebras will stand in an alert posture; with ears erect, head held high, and staring. When tense they will also snort. When a predator is spotted or sensed, a zebra will bark (or bray) loudly.. Mother and foal at the Dallas Zoo. Zebras are very adaptable grazers. They feed mainly on grasses but will also eat shrubs, herbs, twigs, leaves and bark. Their well adapted digestive system allows them to subsist on diets of lower nutritional quality than that necessary for herbivores.. Like most animal species, female zebras mature earlier than the males and a mare may have her first foal by the age of three. Males are not able to breed until the age of five or six. Mares may give birth to one foal every twelve months. She nurses the foal for up to a year. Like horses, zebras are able to stand, walk and suckle shortly after they're born. A zebra foal is brown and white instead of black and white at birth.. Plains and Mountain zebra foals are protected by their mother as well as the head stallion and the other mares in their group. Grevy’s zebra foals have only their mother as a regular protector since, as noted above, Grevy's zebra groups often disband after a few months..

Attempts have been made to train zebras for riding since they have better resistance than horses to African diseases. However most of these attempts failed, due to the zebra's more unpredictable nature and tendency to panic under stress. For this reason, zebra-mules or zebroids (crosses between any species of zebra and a horse, pony, donkey or ass) are preferred over pure-bred zebras.. In England, the zoological collector Lord Rothschild frequently used zebras to draw a carriage. In 1907, Rosendo Ribeiro, the first doctor in Nairobi, Kenya, used a riding zebra for house-calls. In the mid 1800s Governor George Grey imported zebras to New Zealand from his previous posting in South Africa, and used them to pull his carriage on his privately owned Kawau Island.. A tamed zebra being ridden in East Africa. Captain Horace Hayes, in \"Points of the Horse\" (circa 1893) compared the usefulness of different zebra species. In 1891, Hayes broke a mature, intact Mountain Zebra stallion to ride in two days time, and the animal was quiet enough for his wife to ride and be photographed upon. He found the Burchell's zebra easy to break in and considered it ideal for domestication, as it was immune to the bite of the tsetse fly. He considered the quagga well-suited to domestication due to being easy to train to saddle and harness. Hayes, Capt. Horace (1893),  Points of the Horse, pp. 311-316, London: W. Thacker. Modern man has had great impact on the zebra population. Zebras were, and still are, hunted mainly for their skins. The Cape mountain zebra was hunted to near extinction with less than 100 individuals by the 1930s. However the population has increased to about 700 due to conservation efforts. Both Mountain zebra subspecies are currently protected in national parks but are still endangered.. Zebras on the Botswana coat of arms. The Grevy's zebra is also endangered. Hunting and competition from livestock have greatly decreased their population. Because of the population's small size, environmental hazards, such as drought, are capable of easily affecting the entire species. Plains zebras are much more numerous and have a healthy population. Nevertheless they too are threatened by hunting and habitat change from farming. One subspecies, the quagga, is now extinct.. Zebras have been the subject of African folk tales which tell how they got their stripes. According to a Bushmen folk tale of Namibia, the zebra was once all white but got its black stripes after a fight with a baboon over a waterhole. After kicking the baboon so hard the zebra lost his balance and tripped over a fire and the fire sticks left scorches mark all over this white coat.    In the film Fantasia, two centaurs are depicted being half human and half zebra, instead of the typical half human and half horse.. Illustration of a zebra by Ludolphus. Zebra are a popular subject in art.    The fourth Mughal emperor Jahangir (r.1605-24), commissioned a painting of the zebra, which was completed by Ustad Mansur. Cohen, M.J.

When in movies and cartoons zebras are most often miscellaneous characters but have had some starring roles, notably in Madagascar and Racing Stripes. Zebras are also serve as mascots and symbols for products and corporations, notably Zebra Technologies and Fruit Stripe gum.

Plains zebra. Grevy's zebra. Zebras are African equids best known for their distinctive white and black stripes. Their stripes come in different patterns unique to each individual. They are generally social animals and can be seen in small harems to large herds. In addition to their stripes, zebras have erect, mohawk-like manes. Unlike their closest relatives, horses and asses, zebras have never been truly domesticated.. There are three species of zebra: the Plains Zebra, Grévy's Zebra and the Mountain Zebra. The Plains zebra and the Mountain zebra belong to the subgenus Hippotigris, but Grevy's zebra is the sole species of subgenus Dolichohippus. The latter resembles an ass while the former two are more horse-like. Nevertheless, DNA and molecular data show that zebras do indeed have monophyletic origins. All three belong to the genus Equus along with other living equids. In certain regions of Kenya, Plains zebras and Grevy's zebras coexist.. The unique stripes and behaviors of zebras make these among the animals most familiar to people. They can be found in a variety of habitats, such as grasslands, savannas, woodlands, thorny scrublands, mountains and coastal hills. However, various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations, in particular hunting for skins and habitat destruction. Grevy's zebra and the Mountain zebra are endangered. While Plains zebras are much more plentiful, one subspecies, the quagga, went extinct in the late nineteenth century.. The name \"zebra\" comes from the Old Portuguese word zevra which means \"wild ass\". The pronunciation is     internationally, or     in North America.. Zebras were the second lineage to diverge from the earliest proto-horses, after the asses, around 4 million years ago. Grevy's zebra is believed to have been the first zebra species to emerge. The ancestors of the Equus horses are believed to have been striped, and zebras must have retained the stripes of their ancestors due to their advantage for social animals in tropical environments. Extensive stripes would be of little use to equids that live in low densities in deserts (like asses and some horses) or ones that live in colder climates with shaggy coats and annual shading (like some horses).   Fossils of an ancient equid were discovered in the Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument in Hagerman, Idaho. It was named the Hagerman horse with a scientific name of Equus simplicidens. It is believed to have been similar to the Grevy's zebra.   The animals had stocky zebra-like bodies and short, narrow, donkey-like skulls.    Grevy's zebra also has a donkey-like skull. The Hagerman horse is also called the American zebra or Hagerman zebra.. Zebras in Botswana. There are three extant species. Collectively, two of the species have 8 subspecies (7 extant). Zebra populations are diverse, and the relationships between and the taxonomic status of several of the subspecies are not well known.. * Genus: Equus. ** Subgenus: Hippotigris. *** Plains Zebra, Equus quagga. **** Quagga, Equus quagga quagga (extinct). **** Burchell's Zebra, Equus quagga burchellii (includes Damara Zebra). **** Grant's Zebra, Equus quagga boehmi. **** Selous' Zebra, Equus quagga borensis. **** Chapman's Zebra, Equus quagga chapmani. **** Crawshay's Zebra, Equus quagga crawshayi. *** Mountain Zebra, Equus zebra. **** Cape Mountain Zebra, Equus zebra zebra. **** Hartmann's Mountain Zebra, Equus zebra hartmannae. ** Subgenus: Dolichohippus. *** Grévy's Zebra, Equus grevyi. An albino zebra in captivity. The Plains Zebra (Equus quagga, formerly Equus burchelli) is the most common, and has or had about twelve subspecies distributed across much of southern and eastern Africa. It, or particular subspecies of it, have also been known as the Common Zebra, the Dauw, Burchell's Zebra (actually the subspecies Equus quagga burchellii), Chapman's Zebra, Wahlberg's Zebra, Selous' Zebra, Grant's Zebra, Boehm's Zebra and the Quagga (another extinct subspecies, Equus quagga quagga).. The Mountain Zebra (Equus zebra) of southwest Africa tends to have a sleek coat with a white belly and narrower stripes than the Plains Zebra. It has two subspecies and is classified as vulnerable.. Grévy's Zebra (Equus grevyi) is the largest type, with a long, narrow head making it appear rather mule-like. It is an inhabitant of the semi-arid grasslands of Ethiopia and northern Kenya. Grévy's Zebra is the rarest species of zebra around today, and is classified as endangered.. Although zebra species may have overlapping ranges, they do not interbreed. This held true even when the Quagga and Burchell's race of Plains Zebra shared the same area. In captivity, Plains Zebras have been crossed with Mountain zebras. The hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the Plains Zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern. Attempts to breed a Grévy's Zebra stallion to Mountain Zebra mares resulted in a high rate of miscarriage. In captivity, crosses between zebras and other (non-zebra) equines have produced several distinct hybrids, including the zebroid, zeedonk, zony, and zorse.. It was previously believed that zebras were white animals with black stripes since some zebras have white underbellies. However embryological evidence shows that the animal's background color is dark and the white stripes and bellies are additions.. A mother nursing her young blends into a stand of deadwood.. The stripes are typically vertical on the head, neck, forequarters, and main body, with horizontal stripes at the rear and on the legs of the animal. The \"zebra crossing\" is named after the zebra's black and white stripes.. It has been suggested that the stripes serve as visual cues and identification.  With each striping pattern unique to each individual, zebras can recognize one another by their stripes.. Others believe that the stripes act as a camouflage mechanism. This is accomplished in several ways. First, the vertical striping helps the zebra hide in grass. While seeming absurd at first glance considering that grass is neither white nor black, it is supposed to be effective against the zebra's main predator, the lion, which is color blind. Theoretically a zebra standing still in tall grass may not be noticed at all by a lion. Additionally, since zebras are herd animals, the stripes may help to confuse predators - a number of zebras standing or moving close together may appear as one large animal, making it more difficult for the lion to pick out any single zebra to attack.    A herd of zebras scattering to avoid a predator will also represent to that predator a confused mass of vertical stripes travelling in multiple directions making it difficult for the predator to track an individual visually as it separates from its herdmates, although biologists have never observed lions appearing confused by zebra stripes.. A more recent theory, supported by experiment, posits that the disruptive colouration is also an effective means of confusing the visual system of the blood-sucking tsetse fly. Waage, J. K. (1981). How the zebra got its stripes: biting flies as selective agents in the evolution of zebra colouration. J. Entom. Soc. South Africa. 44: 351 - 358.  Alternative theories include that the stripes coincide with fat patterning beneath the skin, serving as a thermoregulatory mechanism for the zebra, and that wounds sustained disrupt the striping pattern to clearly indicate the fitness of the animal to potential mates.. A zebra walking. Like horses, zebras walk, trot, canter and gallop. They are generally slower than horses but their great stamina helps them outpace predators. When chased, a zebra will zig-zag from side to side making it more difficult for the predator. When cornered the zebra will rear up and kick or bite its attacker.. Closeup of a zebra. Zebras have excellent eyesight. It is believed that they can see in color. Like most ungulates the zebra has its eyes on the sides of its head, giving it a wide field of view. Zebras also have night vision, although not as advanced as that of most of their predators, but their hearing compensates.. Zebras have great hearing, and tend to have larger, rounder ears than horses. Like horses and other ungulates, zebra can turn their ears in almost any direction. In addition to eyesight and hearing, zebras have an acute sense of smell and taste.. Zebras in Tanzania. Like most members of the horse family, zebras are highly sociable. Their social structure, however, depends on the species. Mountain zebras and Plains zebras live in groups, known as 'harems', consisting of one stallion with up to six mares and their foals. Bachelor males either live alone or with groups of other bachelors until they are old enough to challenge a breeding stallion. When attacked by packs of hyenas or wild dogs, a zebra group will huddle together with the foals in the middle while the stallion tries to ward them off.. Unlike the other zebra species, Grevy's zebras do not have permanent social bonds. A group of these zebras rarely stays together for more than a few months. The foals stay with their mother, while the adult male lives alone. However like the other two zebra species, bachelor male zebras will organize in groups.. Like horses, zebras sleep standing up and only sleep when neighbors are around to warn them of predators.. A zebra feeding on grass. Zebras communicate with each other with high pitched barks and whinnying. Grevy's zebras make mule-like brays. A zebra’s ears signify its mood. When a zebra is in a calm, tense or friendly mood, its ears stand erect. When it is frightened, its ears are pushed forward. When angry, the ears are pulled backward. When surveying an area for predators, zebras will stand in an alert posture; with ears erect, head held high, and staring. When tense they will also snort. When a predator is spotted or sensed, a zebra will bark (or bray) loudly.. Mother and foal at the Dallas Zoo. Zebras are very adaptable grazers. They feed mainly on grasses but will also eat shrubs, herbs, twigs, leaves and bark. Their well adapted digestive system allows them to subsist on diets of lower nutritional quality than that necessary for herbivores.. Like most animal species, female zebras mature earlier than the males and a mare may have her first foal by the age of three. Males are not able to breed until the age of five or six. Mares may give birth to one foal every twelve months. She nurses the foal for up to a year. Like horses, zebras are able to stand, walk and suckle shortly after they're born. A zebra foal is brown and white instead of black and white at birth.. Plains and Mountain zebra foals are protected by their mother as well as the head stallion and the other mares in their group. Grevy’s zebra foals have only their mother as a regular protector since, as noted above, Grevy's zebra groups often disband after a few months.. Lord Rothschild with his famed zebra carriage (Equus burchelli), which he frequently drove through London. Attempts have been made to train zebras for riding since they have better resistance than horses to African diseases. However most of these attempts failed, due to the zebra's more unpredictable nature and tendency to panic under stress. For this reason, zebra-mules or zebroids (crosses between any species of zebra and a horse, pony, donkey or ass) are preferred over pure-bred zebras.. In England, the zoological collector Lord Rothschild frequently used zebras to draw a carriage. In 1907, Rosendo Ribeiro, the first doctor in Nairobi, Kenya, used a riding zebra for house-calls. In the mid 1800s Governor George Grey imported zebras to New Zealand from his previous posting in South Africa, and used them to pull his carriage on his privately owned Kawau Island.. A tamed zebra being ridden in East Africa. Captain Horace Hayes, in \"Points of the Horse\" (circa 1893) compared the usefulness of different zebra species. In 1891, Hayes broke a mature, intact Mountain Zebra stallion to ride in two days time, and the animal was quiet enough for his wife to ride and be photographed upon. He found the Burchell's zebra easy to break in and considered it ideal for domestication, as it was immune to the bite of the tsetse fly. He considered the quagga well-suited to domestication due to being easy to train to saddle and harness. Hayes, Capt. Horace (1893),  Points of the Horse, pp. 311-316, London: W. Thacker. Modern man has had great impact on the zebra population. Zebras were, and still are, hunted mainly for their skins. The Cape mountain zebra was hunted to near extinction with less than 100 individuals by the 1930s. However the population has increased to about 700 due to conservation efforts. Both Mountain zebra subspecies are currently protected in national parks but are still endangered.. Zebras on the Botswana coat of arms. The Grevy's zebra is also endangered. Hunting and competition from livestock have greatly decreased their population. Because of the population's small size, environmental hazards, such as drought, are capable of easily affecting the entire species. Plains zebras are much more numerous and have a healthy population. Nevertheless they too are threatened by hunting and habitat change from farming. One subspecies, the quagga, is now extinct.. Zebras have been the subject of African folk tales which tell how they got their stripes. According to a Bushmen folk tale of Namibia, the zebra was once all white but got its black stripes after a fight with a baboon over a waterhole. After kicking the baboon so hard the zebra lost his balance and tripped over a fire and the fire sticks left scorches mark all over this white coat.    In the film Fantasia, two centaurs are depicted being half human and half zebra, instead of the typical half human and half horse.. Illustration of a zebra by Ludolphus.

When in movies and cartoons zebras are most often miscellaneous characters but have had some starring roles, notably in Madagascar and Racing Stripes. Zebras are also serve as mascots and symbols for products and corporations, notably Zebra Technologies and Fruit Stripe gum.

Plains zebra. Grevy's zebra. Zebras are African equids best known for their distinctive white and black stripes. Their stripes come in different patterns unique to each individual. They are generally social animals and can be seen in small harems to large herds. In addition to their stripes, zebras have erect, mohawk-like manes. Unlike their closest relatives, horses and asses, zebras have never been truly domesticated.. There are three species of zebra: the Plains Zebra, Grévy's Zebra and the Mountain Zebra. The Plains zebra and the Mountain zebra belong to the subgenus Hippotigris, but Grevy's zebra is the sole species of subgenus Dolichohippus. The latter resembles an ass while the former two are more horse-like. Nevertheless, DNA and molecular data show that zebras do indeed have monophyletic origins. All three belong to the genus Equus along with other living equids. In certain regions of Kenya, Plains zebras and Grevy's zebras coexist.. The unique stripes and behaviors of zebras make these among the animals most familiar to people. They can be found in a variety of habitats, such as grasslands, savannas, woodlands, thorny scrublands, mountains and coastal hills. However, various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations, in particular hunting for skins and habitat destruction. Grevy's zebra and the Mountain zebra are endangered. While Plains zebras are much more plentiful, one subspecies, the quagga, went extinct in the late nineteenth century.. The name \"zebra\" comes from the Old Portuguese word zevra which means \"wild ass\". The pronunciation is     internationally, or     in North America.. Zebras were the second lineage to diverge from the earliest proto-horses, after the asses, around 4 million years ago. Grevy's zebra is believed to have been the first zebra species to emerge. The ancestors of the Equus horses are believed to have been striped, and zebras must have retained the stripes of their ancestors due to their advantage for social animals in tropical environments. Extensive stripes would be of little use to equids that live in low densities in deserts (like asses and some horses) or ones that live in colder climates with shaggy coats and annual shading (like some horses).   Fossils of an ancient equid were discovered in the Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument in Hagerman, Idaho. It was named the Hagerman horse with a scientific name of Equus simplicidens. It is believed to have been similar to the Grevy's zebra.   The animals had stocky zebra-like bodies and short, narrow, donkey-like skulls.    Grevy's zebra also has a donkey-like skull. The Hagerman horse is also called the American zebra or Hagerman zebra.. Zebras in Botswana. There are three extant species. Collectively, two of the species have 8 subspecies (7 extant). Zebra populations are diverse, and the relationships between and the taxonomic status of several of the subspecies are not well known.. * Genus: Equus. ** Subgenus: Hippotigris. *** Plains Zebra, Equus quagga. **** Quagga, Equus quagga quagga (extinct). **** Burchell's Zebra, Equus quagga burchellii (includes Damara Zebra). **** Grant's Zebra, Equus quagga boehmi. **** Selous' Zebra, Equus quagga borensis. **** Chapman's Zebra, Equus quagga chapmani. **** Crawshay's Zebra, Equus quagga crawshayi. *** Mountain Zebra, Equus zebra. **** Cape Mountain Zebra, Equus zebra zebra. **** Hartmann's Mountain Zebra, Equus zebra hartmannae. ** Subgenus: Dolichohippus. *** Grévy's Zebra, Equus grevyi. An albino zebra in captivity. The Plains Zebra (Equus quagga, formerly Equus burchelli) is the most common, and has or had about twelve subspecies distributed across much of southern and eastern Africa. It, or particular subspecies of it, have also been known as the Common Zebra, the Dauw, Burchell's Zebra (actually the subspecies Equus quagga burchellii), Chapman's Zebra, Wahlberg's Zebra, Selous' Zebra, Grant's Zebra, Boehm's Zebra and the Quagga (another extinct subspecies, Equus quagga quagga).. The Mountain Zebra (Equus zebra) of southwest Africa tends to have a sleek coat with a white belly and narrower stripes than the Plains Zebra. It has two subspecies and is classified as vulnerable.. Grévy's Zebra (Equus grevyi) is the largest type, with a long, narrow head making it appear rather mule-like. It is an inhabitant of the semi-arid grasslands of Ethiopia and northern Kenya. Grévy's Zebra is the rarest species of zebra around today, and is classified as endangered.. Although zebra species may have overlapping ranges, they do not interbreed. This held true even when the Quagga and Burchell's race of Plains Zebra shared the same area. In captivity, Plains Zebras have been crossed with Mountain zebras. The hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the Plains Zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern. Attempts to breed a Grévy's Zebra stallion to Mountain Zebra mares resulted in a high rate of miscarriage. In captivity, crosses between zebras and other (non-zebra) equines have produced several distinct hybrids, including the zebroid, zeedonk, zony, and zorse.. It was previously believed that zebras were white animals with black stripes since some zebras have white underbellies. However embryological evidence shows that the animal's background color is dark and the white stripes and bellies are additions.. A mother nursing her young blends into a stand of deadwood.. The stripes are typically vertical on the head, neck, forequarters, and main body, with horizontal stripes at the rear and on the legs of the animal. The \"zebra crossing\" is named after the zebra's black and white stripes.. It has been suggested that the stripes serve as visual cues and identification.  With each striping pattern unique to each individual, zebras can recognize one another by their stripes.. Others believe that the stripes act as a camouflage mechanism. This is accomplished in several ways. First, the vertical striping helps the zebra hide in grass. While seeming absurd at first glance considering that grass is neither white nor black, it is supposed to be effective against the zebra's main predator, the lion, which is color blind. Theoretically a zebra standing still in tall grass may not be noticed at all by a lion. Additionally, since zebras are herd animals, the stripes may help to confuse predators - a number of zebras standing or moving close together may appear as one large animal, making it more difficult for the lion to pick out any single zebra to attack.    A herd of zebras scattering to avoid a predator will also represent to that predator a confused mass of vertical stripes travelling in multiple directions making it difficult for the predator to track an individual visually as it separates from its herdmates, although biologists have never observed lions appearing confused by zebra stripes.. A more recent theory, supported by experiment, posits that the disruptive colouration is also an effective means of confusing the visual system of the blood-sucking tsetse fly. Waage, J. K. (1981). How the zebra got its stripes: biting flies as selective agents in the evolution of zebra colouration. J. Entom. Soc. South Africa. 44: 351 - 358.  Alternative theories include that the stripes coincide with fat patterning beneath the skin, serving as a thermoregulatory mechanism for the zebra, and that wounds sustained disrupt the striping pattern to clearly indicate the fitness of the animal to potential mates.. A zebra walking. Like horses, zebras walk, trot, canter and gallop. They are generally slower than horses but their great stamina helps them outpace predators. When chased, a zebra will zig-zag from side to side making it more difficult for the predator. When cornered the zebra will rear up and kick or bite its attacker.. Closeup of a zebra. Zebras have excellent eyesight. It is believed that they can see in color. Like most ungulates the zebra has its eyes on the sides of its head, giving it a wide field of view. Zebras also have night vision, although not as advanced as that of most of their predators, but their hearing compensates.. Zebras have great hearing, and tend to have larger, rounder ears than horses. Like horses and other ungulates, zebra can turn their ears in almost any direction. In addition to eyesight and hearing, zebras have an acute sense of smell and taste.. Zebras in Tanzania. Like most members of the horse family, zebras are highly sociable. Their social structure, however, depends on the species. Mountain zebras and Plains zebras live in groups, known as 'harems', consisting of one stallion with up to six mares and their foals. Bachelor males either live alone or with groups of other bachelors until they are old enough to challenge a breeding stallion. When attacked by packs of hyenas or wild dogs, a zebra group will huddle together with the foals in the middle while the stallion tries to ward them off.. Unlike the other zebra species, Grevy's zebras do not have permanent social bonds. A group of these zebras rarely stays together for more than a few months. The foals stay with their mother, while the adult male lives alone. However like the other two zebra species, bachelor male zebras will organize in groups.. Like horses, zebras sleep standing up and only sleep when neighbors are around to warn them of predators.. A zebra feeding on grass. Zebras communicate with each other with high pitched barks and whinnying. Grevy's zebras make mule-like brays. A zebra’s ears signify its mood. When a zebra is in a calm, tense or friendly mood, its ears stand erect. When it is frightened, its ears are pushed forward. When angry, the ears are pulled backward. When surveying an area for predators, zebras will stand in an alert posture; with ears erect, head held high, and staring. When tense they will also snort. When a predator is spotted or sensed, a zebra will bark (or bray) loudly.. Mother and foal at the Dallas Zoo. Zebras are very adaptable grazers. They feed mainly on grasses but will also eat shrubs, herbs, twigs, leaves and bark. Their well adapted digestive system allows them to subsist on diets of lower nutritional quality than that necessary for herbivores.. Like most animal species, female zebras mature earlier than the males and a mare may have her first foal by the age of three. Males are not able to breed until the age of five or six. Mares may give birth to one foal every twelve months. She nurses the foal for up to a year. Like horses, zebras are able to stand, walk and suckle shortly after they're born. A zebra foal is brown and white instead of black and white at birth.. Plains and Mountain zebra foals are protected by their mother as well as the head stallion and the other mares in their group. Grevy’s zebra foals have only their mother as a regular protector since, as noted above, Grevy's zebra groups often disband after a few months.. Lord Rothschild with his famed zebra carriage (Equus burchelli), which he frequently drove through London. Attempts have been made to train zebras for riding since they have better resistance than horses to African diseases. However most of these attempts failed, due to the zebra's more unpredictable nature and tendency to panic under stress. For this reason, zebra-mules or zebroids (crosses between any species of zebra and a horse, pony, donkey or ass) are preferred over pure-bred zebras.. In England, the zoological collector Lord Rothschild frequently used zebras to draw a carriage. In 1907, Rosendo Ribeiro, the first doctor in Nairobi, Kenya, used a riding zebra for house-calls. In the mid 1800s Governor George Grey imported zebras to New Zealand from his previous posting in South Africa, and used them to pull his carriage on his privately owned Kawau Island.. A tamed zebra being ridden in East Africa. Captain Horace Hayes, in \"Points of the Horse\" (circa 1893) compared the usefulness of different zebra species. In 1891, Hayes broke a mature, intact Mountain Zebra stallion to ride in two days time, and the animal was quiet enough for his wife to ride and be photographed upon. He found the Burchell's zebra easy to break in and considered it ideal for domestication, as it was immune to the bite of the tsetse fly. He considered the quagga well-suited to domestication due to being easy to train to saddle and harness. Hayes, Capt. Horace (1893),  Points of the Horse, pp. 311-316, London: W. Thacker. Modern man has had great impact on the zebra population. Zebras were, and still are, hunted mainly for their skins. The Cape mountain zebra was hunted to near extinction with less than 100 individuals by the 1930s. However the population has increased to about 700 due to conservation efforts. Both Mountain zebra subspecies are currently protected in national parks but are still endangered.. Zebras on the Botswana coat of arms. The Grevy's zebra is also endangered. Hunting and competition from livestock have greatly decreased their population. Because of the population's small size, environmental hazards, such as drought, are capable of easily affecting the entire species. Plains zebras are much more numerous and have a healthy population. Nevertheless they too are threatened by hunting and habitat change from farming. One subspecies, the quagga, is now extinct.. Zebras have been the subject of African folk tales which tell how they got their stripes. According to a Bushmen folk tale of Namibia, the zebra was once all white but got its black stripes after a fight with a baboon over a waterhole. After kicking the baboon so hard the zebra lost his balance and tripped over a fire and the fire sticks left scorches mark all over this white coat.    In the film Fantasia, two centaurs are depicted being half human and half zebra, instead of the typical half human and half horse.. Illustration of a zebra by Ludolphus. Zebra are a popular subject in art.    The fourth Mughal emperor Jahangir (r.1605-24), commissioned a painting of the zebra, which was completed by Ustad Mansur. Cohen, M.J.

When in movies and cartoons zebras are most often miscellaneous characters but have had some starring roles, notably in Madagascar and Racing Stripes. Zebras are also serve as mascots and symbols for products and corporations, notably Zebra Technologies and Fruit Stripe gum.

              "      <td>Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the sixteenth President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1861 until his assassination. As an outspoken opponent of the expansion of slavery in the United States, \"[I]n his short autobiography written for the 1860 presidential campaign, Lincoln would describe his protest in the Illinois legislature as one that 'briefly defined his position on the slavery question, and so far as it goes, it was then the same that it is now.\" This was in reference to the anti-expansion sentiments he had then expressed. Doris Kearns Goodwin, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln (2005) p. 91.  Holzer pg. 232.  Writing of the Cooper Union  speech, Holzer notes, \"Cooper Union proved a unique confluence of political culture, rhetorical opportunity, technological innovation, and human genius, and it brought Abraham Lincoln to the center stage of American politics at precisely the right time and place, and with precisely the right message: that slavery was wrong, and ought to be confined to the areas where it already existed, and placed on the 'course of ultimate extinction... .'\"  Lincoln won the Republican Party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year. During his term, he helped preserve the United States by leading the defeat of the secessionist Confederate States of America in the American Civil War. He introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery, issuing his Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1865.. Lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including Ulysses S. Grant. Historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the Republican Party well, bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. Lincoln successfully defused a war scare with the United Kingdom in 1861. Under his leadership, the Union took control of the border slave states at the start of the war. Additionally, he managed his own reelection in the 1864 presidential election.. Opponents of the war (also known as \"Copperheads\") criticized him for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans, an abolitionist faction of the Republican Party, criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. Even with these problems, Lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches; his Gettysburg Address is but one example of this. At the close of the war, Lincoln held a moderate view of Reconstruction, seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. His assassination in 1865 was the first presidential assassination in U.S. history and made him a martyr for the ideal of national unity.. Scholars now rank Lincoln among the top three U.S. Presidents, with the majority of those surveyed placing him first. He is noted for his lasting influence on U.S. politics, including a redefinition of republicanism.  As Diggins explains, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.\" John Patrick Diggins, The Lost Soul of American Politics: Virtue, Self-interest, and the Foundations of Liberalism (1986) p. 307. Foner (1970) p. 215 noted that, \"Lincoln stressed the moral basis of Republicanism.\" Jaffa (2000) p. 399, stresses Lincoln's emphasis on the Declaration of Independence as what Lincoln called the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism. See also McPherson (1992) pp.61-64.. Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, to Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks, two uneducated farmers. Lincoln was born in a one-room log cabin on the   Sinking Spring Farm, in southeast Hardin County, Kentucky (now part of LaRue County). This area was at the time considered the \"frontier.\" The name \"Abraham\" was chosen to commemorate his grandfather, who was killed in an American Indian raid in 1786. Donald (1995) p 21  His elder sister, Sarah Lincoln, was born in 1807; a younger brother, Thomas Jr, died in infancy. It is sometimes debated whether Lincoln had Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of the connective tissue characterized by long limbs and great physical stature.  Marfan syndrome: Introduction Aug 1, 2006. Symbolic log cabin at Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site.. For some time, Thomas Lincoln was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the Kentucky back country. He had purchased the Sinking Spring Farm in December of 1808 for $200 cash and assumption of a debt.  The farm site is now preserved as part of Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site.  The family belonged to a Baptist church that had seceded from a larger church over the issue of slavery. Though Lincoln was exposed to his parents' anti-slavery sentiment from a very young age, he never joined their church, or any other church for that matter.  As a youth he had little use for religion. Life of Abraham Lincoln, Colonel Ward H. Lamon, 1872 - portions reprinted in  Chapter VIII: Abraham Lincoln, Deist, and Admirer of Thomas Paine, From the book Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents by Franklin Steiner (1936). Lincoln was just seven years old when, in 1816, the family was forced to make a new start in Perry County (now in Spencer County), Indiana. He later noted that this move was \"partly on account of slavery,\" and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in Kentucky: Unlike land in the Northwest Territory, Kentucky never had a proper U.S. survey, and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property. Lincoln was only nine when his mother, then thirty-four years old, died of milk sickness. Soon afterwards, his father remarried  to Sarah Bush Johnston. Sarah Lincoln raised young Lincoln like one of her own children. Years later she compared Lincoln to her own son, saying \"Both were good boys, but I must say — both now being dead that Abe was the best boy I ever saw or ever expect to see.\" Lincoln was affectionate toward his stepmother, whom he would call \"Mother\" for the rest of his life, but he was distant from his father.  Donald, (1995) pp. 28, 152.. In 1830, after more economic and land-title difficulties in Indiana, the family settled on public land  /ref&gt; in Macon County, Illinois. Some scholars believe that it was his father's repeated land-title difficulties and ensuing financial hardships that led young Lincoln to study law.  The following winter was desolate and especially brutal, and the family considered moving back to Indiana. The following year, when his father relocated the family to a new homestead in Coles County, Illinois, twenty-two-year-old Lincoln struck out on his own, canoeing down the Sangamon River to the village of New Salem in Sangamon County. Later that year, hired by New Salem businessman Denton Offutt and accompanied by friends, he took goods from New Salem to New Orleans via flatboat on the Sangamon, Illinois and Mississippi rivers. While in New Orleans, he may have witnessed a slave auction, though as a frequent visitor to Kentucky, he would have had several earlier opportunities to witness  similar sales.  Donald, (1995) ch. 2.. Lincoln's formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling. Largely self-educated, he read every book he could get his hands on, once walking.  just to borrow one  While his favorite book was The Life of George Washington, Lincoln mastered the Bible, Shakespeare, and English and American history, and developed a plain writing style that puzzled audiences more used to grandiose rhetoric. He was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an ax; some rails he had allegedly split in his youth were exhibited at the 1860 Republican National Convention, as the party celebrated the poor-boy-made-good theme. Lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals, even for food. Though he was unusually tall at  , 4 inches and strong, Lincoln spent so much time reading that some neighbors suspected he must be doing it to avoid strenuous manual labor.. Young Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln began his political career in 1832, at age 23, with an unsuccessful campaign for the Illinois General Assembly, as a member of the Whig Party.  He ran eighth in a field of 13 candidates.  The centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the Sangamon River. He believed that this would attract steamboat traffic, which would allow the sparsely populated, poorer areas along the river to flourish.. He was elected captain of an Illinois militia company drawn from New Salem during the Black Hawk War, and later wrote that he had not had \"any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction.\"  Thomas (1952) 32-34; Basler (1946) p. 551   Though he never saw combat, Lincoln did assist in burying the dead from the Battle of Stillman's Run the day after Major Isaiah Stillman's troops fled the field of battle.  Abraham Lincoln Online Retrieved on March 11, 2007. For several months, Lincoln ran a small store in New Salem, selling tea, coffee, sugar, salt, blue calico, brown muslin, straw hats and whiskey.  Beveridge (1928) 1:127-8  Later, he found work as village postmaster and as a surveyor.. In 1834, he won election to the state legislature, and after coming across the Commentaries on the Laws of England, began to teach himself law. Admitted to the bar in 1837, he moved to Springfield, Illinois, that same year and began to practice law with John T. Stuart. With a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and in his closing arguments, Lincoln became one of the most respected and successful lawyers in Illinois and grew steadily more prosperous.. He served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a representative from Sangamon County, and became a leader of the Illinois Whig party. In 1837, he made his first protest against slavery in the Illinois House, stating that the institution was \"founded on both injustice and bad policy.\"  Protest in Illinois Legislature on Slavery, p.75, March 3, 1837  It was also in this same year that Lincoln met Joshua Fry Speed, who would become his most intimate friend.. Lincoln wrote a series of anonymous letters, published in 1842 in the Sangamon Journal, mocking State Auditor and prominent Democrat James Shields. Shields would later become a U.S. senator, but when he learned that it was Lincoln who had been writing the barbs, he challenged him to a duel. As Shields was the challenger, Lincoln was granted the right to choose the weapon and specified \"Cavalry broad swords of the largest size.\" Much taller and with long arms, this gave him an overwhelming advantage over his opponent; however, the duel was called off at the last minute. Beveridge (1928) 1:349. Lincoln had been practicing with the broad sword.  Two years later, Lincoln entered law practice with William Herndon, a fellow Whig. In 1854, both men joined the fledgling Republican Party. Following Lincoln's death, Herndon began collecting stories about Lincoln and published them in Herndon's Lincoln.. The first photograph ever taken of Mary Lincoln, a daguerreotype by Shepherd in 1846.. On November 4 1842 Lincoln married Mary Todd, daughter of a prominent slave-owning family from Kentucky. The couple had four sons. Robert Todd Lincoln was born in Springfield, Illinois on 1 August, 1843. Their only child to survive into adulthood, young Robert attended Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard College. Robert died on July 26, 1926, in Manchester, Vermont.. The other Lincoln children were born in Springfield, Illinois, and died either during childhood or their teen years. Edward Baker Lincoln was born on March 10, 1846, and died on 1 February, 1850, also in Springfield. William Wallace Lincoln was born on December 21, 1850, and died on February 20, 1862 in Washington, D.C., during Pres. Lincoln's first term. Thomas \"Tad\" Lincoln was born on 4 April, 1853, and died on July 16, 1871 in Chicago.. Four of his wife's brothers fought for the Confederacy, with one wounded and another killed in action. Lieutenant David H. Todd, a half-brother of Mary Todd Lincoln, served as commandant of the Libby Prison camp during the war.. The first photograph ever taken of Abraham Lincoln, a daguerreotype taken by Shepherd in 1846.. A Whig and an admirer of party leader Henry Clay,  Lincoln was elected to a term in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1846. As a freshman House member, he was not a particularly powerful or influential figure. He spoke out against the Mexican-American War, which he attributed to President Polk's desire for \"military glory — that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood.\" He also challenged the President's claims regarding the Texas boundary and offered Spot Resolutions demanding to know on what \"spot\" on US soil that blood was first spilt.  Congressional Globe, 30th Session (1848) pp.93-95  In January of 1848, he was among the 82 Whigs who defeated 81 Democrats in a procedural vote on an amendment to send a routine resolution back to committee with instructions to add the words \"a war unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the President of the United States.\" The amendment passed, but the bill never reemerged from committee and was never finally voted upon.  House Journal, 30th Session (1848) pp.183-184. Lincoln later damaged his political reputation with a speech in which he declared, \"God of Heaven has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent, and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men, women, and children, and lay waste and pillage the land of the just.\" Two weeks later, President Polk sent a peace treaty to Congress. While no one in Washington paid any attention to Lincoln, the Democrats orchestrated angry outbursts from across his district, where the war was popular and many had volunteered. In Morgan County, resolutions were adopted in fervent support of the war and in wrathful denunciation of the \"treasonable assaults of guerrillas at home; party demagogues; slanderers of the President; defenders of the butchery at the Alamo; traducers of the heroism at San Jacinto.\"  Abe Lincoln resource page. Warned by his law partner, William Herndon, that the damage was mounting and irreparable, Lincoln decided not to run for reelection. In fact, in 1848 he campaigned vigorously for Zachary Taylor, the successful general whose atrocities he had denounced in January. Regardless, his statements were not easily forgotten, and would haunt him during the Civil War. These statements were also held against him when he applied for a position in the new Taylor administration. Instead, Taylor's people offered Lincoln various positions in the remote Oregon Territory, primarily the governorship. Acceptance of this offer would have ended his career in the rapidly growing state of Illinois, so Lincoln declined the position. Returning to Springfield, Lincoln gave up politics for several years and turned his energies to his law practice. During this time, he made many trips on horseback between various counties' courthouses. Beveridge, (1928) 1: 428-33; Donald (1995) p. 140-43.. In the 1920s historical markers were placed at the county lines along the route Lincoln traveled in the eight judicial district. This example is on the border of Piatt and DeWitt counties. By the mid-1850s, Lincoln's caseload focused largely on the competing transportation interests of river barges and railroads. In one prominent 1851 case, he represented the Alton &amp; Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with a shareholder, James A. Barret. Barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to the railroad on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. Lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest, that the newer route proposed by Alton &amp; Sangamon was superior and less expensive, and that accordingly, the corporation had a right to sue Barret for his delinquent payment. He won this case, and the decision by the Illinois Supreme Court was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the United States. Donald, (1995) ch. 6.. Possibly the most notable criminal trial of Lincoln's career as a lawyer came in 1858, when he defended William \"Duff\" Armstrong, who has been charged with murder. The case became famous for Lincoln's use of judicial notice--a rare tactic at that time--to show that an eyewitness had lied on the stand. After the witness testified to having seen the crime by moonlight, Lincoln produced a Farmers' Almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle that it could not have provided enough illumination to see anything clearly. Based almost entirely on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted. Donald (1995), 150-51. Lincoln was involved in more than 5,100 cases in Illinois alone during his 23-year legal career. Though many of these cases involved little more than filing a writ, others were more substantial and quite involved. Lincoln and his partners appeared before the Illinois State Supreme Court more than 400 times. During one trial, Lincoln's voir dire included a question to prospective jurors as to whether they were acquainted with counsel for the other side. When a few of them turned out to know the other lawyer, the judge interrupted, saying, \"Mr. Lincoln, you are wasting the time of the court. The fact that a prospective juror knows your opponent does not disqualify him.\". \"No, Your Honor, I understand that,\" Lincoln answered. \"I'm afraid that some of them might not know him, which would place me at a disadvantage.\". Lincoln returned to politics in response to the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854), which expressly repealed the limits on slavery's extent as determined by the Missouri Compromise (1820). Illinois Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, the most powerful man in the Senate, proposed popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse, and incorporated it into the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory, rather than have such a decision imposed on them by Congress.  Donald, (1995) ch. 7.. In a speech against the act, on October 16 1854, delivered in Peoria, Lincoln first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day:. Drawing on remnants of the old Whig, Free Soil, Liberty and Democratic parties, he was instrumental in forming the new Republican Party. In a stirring campaign, the Republicans carried Illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. Lincoln was the obvious choice, but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an ex-Democrat Lyman Trumbull.. In 1857-58, Douglas broke with President Buchanan, leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state. Accepting the Republican nomination for Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered his famous speech: \"'A house divided against itself cannot stand.'(Mark 3:25) I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.\"  A House Divided Against Itself Cannot Stand, June 1858  The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the north.. The 1858 campaign featured the Lincoln-Douglas debates, a nationally famous contest on slavery. Lincoln warned that the \"Slave Power\" was threatening the values of republicanism, while Douglas emphasized the supremacy of democracy, as set forth in his Freeport Doctrine, which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not. Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature reelected Douglas to the Senate. Nevertheless, Lincoln's eloquence transformed him into a national political star.. During the debates of 1858, the issue of race was often discussed. During a time period when few believed in racial egalitarianism, Stephen Douglas informed the crowds, \"If you desire Negro citizenship… if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves… then support Mr. Lincoln and the Black Republican party, who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro.\"  First Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Ottawa, Illinois, August 21, 1858  Lincoln countered that he was \"not in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races.\"  Fourth Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Charleston, Illinois, September 18, 1858  His opposition to slavery was opposition to the Slave Power, though this would change during the course of the Civil War. Donald, (1995) ch. 8.. On May 9-10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur. At this convention, Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.. \"The Rail Candidate,\" Lincoln's 1860 candidacy is held up by slavery issue (slave on left) and party organization (New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley on right). Photo of Lincoln taken February 27, 1860 in New York City by Mathew Brady, the day of his famous Cooper Union speech.. Entering the presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog, Lincoln was eventually chosen as the Republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. His expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase. His \"Western\" origins also appealed to the newer states: other contenders, especially those with more governmental experience, had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states, while Lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the West. Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government. Yet despite his Southern connections (his in-laws owned slaves), Lincoln misunderstood the depth of the revolution underway in the South and the emergence of Southern nationalism. Throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war, and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession.  Gabor S. Boritt, \"'And the War Came'? Abraham Lincoln and the Question of Individual Responsibility,\" Why the Civil War Came ed by Boritt (1996), pp 3-30.. Throughout the election, Lincoln did not campaign or give speeches. This was handled by the state and county Republican organizations, who used the latest techniques to sustain party enthusiasm and thus obtain high turnout. There was little effort to convert non-Republicans, and there was virtually no campaigning in the South except for a few border cities such as St. Louis, Missouri, and Wheeling, Virginia; indeed, the party did not even run a slate in most of the South. In the North, there were thousands of Republican speakers, tons of campaign posters and leaflets, and thousands of newspaper editorials. These focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, making the most of his boyhood poverty, his pioneer background, his native genius, and his rise from obscurity. His nicknames, \"Honest Abe\" and \"the Rail-Splitter,\" were exploited to the full. The goal was to emphasize the superior power of \"free labor,\" whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts.  Thomas (1952) p 216; Reinhard H. Luthin, The First Lincoln Campaign (1944); Nevins vol 4;. On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, John C. Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and John Bell of the new Constitutional Union Party. He was the first Republican president, winning entirely on the strength of his support in the North: he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the South, and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other Southern states. Lincoln gained 1,865,908 votes (39.9% of the total), for 180 electoral votes; Douglas, 1,380,202 (29.5%) for 12 electoral votes; Breckenridge, 848,019 (18.1%) for 72 electoral votes; and Bell, 590,901 (12.5%) for 39 electoral votes. There were fusion tickets in some states, but even if his opponents had combined in every state, Lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election.. As Lincoln's election became more likely, secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the Union. South Carolina took the lead, followed by six other cotton-growing states in the deep South. The upper South (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to and rejected the secessionist appeal. They decided to stay in the Union, though they warned Lincoln that they would not support an invasion through their territory. The seven Confederate states seceded before Lincoln took office, declaring themselves to be a new nation, the Confederate States of America. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy.. President-elect Lincoln evaded possible assassins in Baltimore, and on February 23, 1861, arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C. At his inauguration on March 4, 1861, the German American Turners formed Lincoln's bodyguard; and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present, ready to protect the capital from Confederate invasion and local insurrection.. Photograph showing the March 4, 1861, inauguration of Abraham Lincoln in front of United States Capitol.. In his First Inaugural Address, Lincoln declared, \"I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments,\" arguing further that the purpose of the United States Constitution was \"to form a more perfect union\" than the Articles of Confederation which were explicitly perpetual, thus the Constitution too was perpetual. He asked rhetorically that even were the Constitution a simple contract, would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?. Also in his inaugural address, in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war, Lincoln supported the pending Corwin Amendment to the Constitution, which had already passed Congress. This amendment, which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it existed, was designed to appeal not to the Confederacy but to the critical border states. At the same time, Lincoln adamantly opposed the Crittenden Compromise, which would have permitted slavery in the territories. Despite support for the Crittenden compromise among some prominent Republicans (including William Seward), Lincoln denounced it saying that it \"would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people, tribe, and state owning a foot of land between here and Tierra del Fuego.\". By the time Lincoln took office, the Confederacy was an established fact, and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. No compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. Lincoln might have allowed the southern states to secede, and some Republicans recommended that. However, conservative Democratic nationalists, such as Jeremiah S. Black, Joseph Holt, and Edwin M. Stanton had taken control of Buchanan's cabinet around January 1, 1861, and refused to accept secession. Lincoln and nearly every Republican leader adopted this position by March 1861: the Union could not be dismantled. However, as a strict follower of the constitution, Lincoln refused to take any action against the South unless the Unionists themselves were attacked first. This finally happened in April 1861.. Historian Allan Nevins argues that Lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the Union, hold government property, and still avoid war. He \"temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis,\" overestimated the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South and border states, and misunderstood the conditional support of Unionists in the border states.  Allan Nevins, The Improvised War, 1861-1862 (1959) p 29. In April 1861, after Union troops at Fort Sumter were fired upon and forced to surrender, Lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and \"preserve the Union,\" which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. Virginia, which had repeatedly warned Lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state, responded by seceding, along with North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas.. The slave states of Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware did not secede, and Lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there, promising not to interfere with slavery. After the fighting started, he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas (especially in Maryland) and held in military prisons without trial. Over 18,000 were arrested, though none were executed. One, Clement Vallandigham, was exiled; but all of the remainder were released, usually after two or three months (see: Ex parte Merryman).. Lincoln met with his cabinet for the first reading of the Emancipation Proclamation draft on July 22, 1862. L-R: Edwin M. Stanton, Salmon P. Chase, Abraham Lincoln, Gideon Welles, Caleb B. Smith, William H. Seward, Montgomery Blair and Edward Bates. In July 1862, Congress moved to free the slaves by passing the Second Confiscation Act. The goal was to weaken the rebellion, which was led and controlled by slave owners. While it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery (the Thirteenth Amendment did that), the Act showed that Lincoln had the support of Congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. This new law was implemented with Lincoln's \"Emancipation Proclamation.\". Lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the United States. In 1861 – 1862, however, he made it clear that the North was fighting the war to preserve the Union, not to abolish slavery. Freeing the slaves became, in late 1862, a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. Abolitionists criticized Lincoln for his sluggishness over slavery per se, but on August 22, 1862, Lincoln explained:. The Emancipation Proclamation, announced on September 22 and put into effect on January 1, 1863, freed slaves in territories not under Union control. As Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all of them in Confederate hands (over three million) were freed. Lincoln later said: \"I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.\" The proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. Lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation. Lincoln addressed the issue of his consistency in an 1864 letter to Albert G. Hodges.  Letter to Albert G. Hodges, April 4, 1864. In September 1862, thirteen northern governors met in Altoona, Pennsylvania, at the Loyal War Governors' Conference to discuss the Proclamation and Union war effort. In the end, the state executives fully supported the president's Proclamation and also suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union's Army of the Potomac.  Images of America: Altoona, by Sr. Anne Francis Pulling, 2001, 10.. For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. As Frederick Douglass observed, Lincoln was, \"The first great man that I talked with in the United States freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself, of the difference of color.\" Life and Times of Frederick Douglass, by Frederick Douglass, 1895. After Union victories at Gettysburg, Vicksburg and Chattanooga in 1863, victory seemed at hand, and Lincoln promoted Ulysses S. Grant General-in-Chief ( March 12, 1864). When the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates, Lincoln supported Grant's strategy of wearing down Lee's Confederate army at the cost of heavy Union casualties. With an election looming, he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. At the Convention, the Republican Party selected Andrew Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. They ran on the new Union Party ticket uniting Republicans and War Democrats.. Lincoln, in top hat, with Allan Pinkerton and Gen. John Alexander McClernand at Antietam.. Nevertheless, Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Acknowledging this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would nonetheless defeat the Confederacy by an all-out military effort before turning over the White House: Mark Grimsley and Brooks D Simpson, eds. The Collapse of the Confederacy (2001) p 80. Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.. While the Democratic platform followed the Peace wing of the party and called the war a \"failure,\" their candidate, General George B. McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform.. Lincoln provided Grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to support Grant and win local support for the war effort. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September ended defeatist jitters; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln; the Union party was united and energized, and Lincoln was easily reelected in a landslide. He won all but two states, capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.. On March 4 1865, Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address, his favorite of all his speeches. At this time, a victory over the rebels was at hand, slavery was dead, and Lincoln was looking to the future.. “Running the ‘Machine’”. An 1864 cartoon featuring Lincoln, William Fessenden, Edwin Stanton, William Seward and Gideon Welles takes a swing at the Lincoln administration. The war was a source of constant frustration for the president, and occupied nearly all of his time. He had a contentious relationship with General McClellan, who became general-in-chief of all the Union armies in the wake of the embarrassing Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run and after the retirement of Winfield Scott in late 1861. Despite his inexperience in military affairs, Lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. His priorities were twofold: to ensure that Washington, D.C., was well defended; and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the Northern public and press. McClellan, a youthful West Point graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service, took a more cautious approach. He took several months to plan and execute his Peninsula Campaign, with the objective of capturing Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula between the James and York Rivers. McClellan's delay irritated Lincoln, as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend Washington, D.C. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops to defend the capital, a decision McClellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.. McClellan, a lifelong Democrat who was temperamentally conservative, was relieved as general-in-chief after releasing his Harrison's Landing Letter, where he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint John Pope, a Republican, as head of the new Army of Virginia. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack. But Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. In response to his failure, Pope was sent to Minnesota to fight the Sioux.. An 1864 Mathew Brady photo depicts President Lincoln reading a book with his youngest son, Tad. Panicked by Lee's invasion of Maryland, Lincoln restored McClellan to command of all forces around Washington in time for the Battle of Antietam (September 1862). The ensuing Union victory enabled Lincoln to release his Emancipation Proclamation, but he relieved McClellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed Republican Ambrose Burnside to head the Army of the Potomac. Burnside had promised to follow through on Lincoln's strategic vision for a strong offensive against Lee and Richmond. After Burnside was stunningly defeated at Fredericksburg, Joseph Hooker was given the command, despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders.  Joseph Hooker biography  Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville (May 1863), and relieved of command early in the subsequent Gettysburg Campaign replaced by George Meade.. After the Union victory at Gettysburg, Meade's failure to pursue Lee and months of inactivity for the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to bring in a western general, Ulysses S. Grant. Grant already had a solid string of victories in the Western Theater, including the battles of Vicksburg and Chattanooga. Responding to criticism of Grant, Lincoln was quoted as saying, \"I cannot spare this man. He fights.\" Grant waged his bloody Overland Campaign in 1864 with a strategy of a war of attrition, characterized by high Union losses at battles such as the Wilderness and Cold Harbor, but by proportionately higher Confederate losses. His invasion campaign eventually bottled Lee up in the Siege of Petersburg, so that Grant could take Richmond, and bring the war to a close in the spring of 1865.. Lincoln authorized Grant to target civilians and infrastructure, hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. This allowed Generals Sherman and Sheridan to destroy farms and towns in the Shenandoah Valley, Georgia, and South Carolina. The damage caused by Sherman's March to the Sea through Georgia totaled in excess of $100 million by Sherman's own estimate. See Hofstadter, Richard, The United States: The History of a Republic, Prentice-Hall, 1967, p. 446.. Lincoln had a star-crossed record as a military leader, possessing a keen understanding of strategic points (such as the Mississippi River and the fortress city of Vicksburg) and the importance of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing cities. He had, however, limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863, when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in Ulysses S. Grant. Only then could he insist on using African American troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.. Throughout the war, Lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. He spent hours at the War Department telegraph office, reading dispatches from his generals. He visited battle sites frequently, and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. During Jubal Anderson Early's raid on Washington, D.C. in 1864, Lincoln had to be told to duck to avoid being shot while observing the battle.. Reconstruction began during the war as Lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the Southern states and what to do with Confederate leaders and the freed slaves. Lincoln led the \"moderates\" regarding Reconstructionist policy, and was usually opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Thaddeus Stevens in the House and Charles Sumner and Benjamin Wade in the Senate (though he cooperated with these men on most other issues). Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind Union lines. His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.  /ref&gt; Critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. Of special importance were Tennessee, where Lincoln appointed Andrew Johnson as governor, and Louisiana, where Lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. The Radicals thought this policy too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864. When Lincoln pocket-vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.  Donald (1995) ch. 20. On April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House in Virginia, and the war was effectively over. The other rebel armies surrendered soon after, and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare. Lincoln went to Richmond to make a public gesture of sitting at Jefferson Davis's own desk, symbolically saying to the nation that the President of the United States held authority over the entire land. He was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves, whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer's quote, \"I know I am free for I have seen the face of Father Abraham and have felt him.\" When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, Lincoln replied, \"Let 'em up easy.\"  Donald (1995) 576, 580,   \"President Lincoln Enters Richmond, 1865\" EyeWitness to History, www.eywitnesstohistory.com (2000).. One of the last photographs of Lincoln, likely taken between February and April 1865. Lincoln's powerful rhetoric defined the issues of the war for the nation, the world, and posterity. His extraordinary command of the English language was evidenced in the Gettysburg Address, a speech dedicating the cemetery at Gettysburg that he delivered on November 19, 1863. The speech defied Lincoln's own prediction that \"the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here.\" Lincoln's second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted. In these speeches, Lincoln articulated better than anyone else the rationale behind the Union cause.. In recent years, historians have stressed Lincoln's use of and redefinition of republican values. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln shifted emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism.  Jaffa (2000) p. 399  The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, rather than the Constitution's tolerance of slavers, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.\"  John Patrick Diggins, The Lost Soul of American Politics: Virtue, Self-interest, and the Foundations of Liberalism (1986) p. 307.  His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.  Foner (1970) p. 215 says, \"Lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism.\"  See also McPherson (1992) pp.61-64.  Nevertheless, in 1861 Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a \"republican form of government\" in every state. Jaffa (2000) p. 263  That duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in Reconstruction.. Lincoln's second inauguration on March 4, 1865. In the photo, Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth, can be seen in the crowd at the top and accomplices David Herold, Lewis Powell, George Atzerodt, John Surratt and Edmund Spangler in the bottom crowd. In his Gettysburg Address Lincoln redefined the American nation, arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776, \"conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\" He declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality, \"that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\" By emphasizing the centrality of the nation, he rebuffed the claims of state sovereignty. While some critics say Lincoln moved too far and too fast,  H.L. Mencken said \"It is difficult to imagine anything more untrue. The Union soldiers in the battle actually fought against self-determination; it was the Confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves.\" Mencken did not mention the right of self-determination rights for blacks.   they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked \"a new founding of the nation.\"  Wills (1992) p. 39.. During the Civil War, Lincoln appropriated powers no previous President had wielded: he used his war powers to proclaim a blockade, suspended the writ of habeas corpus, spent money without congressional authorization, and imprisoned 18,000 suspected Confederate sympathizers without trial. Nearly all of his actions, although vehemently denounced by the Copperheads, were subsequently upheld by Congress and the Courts.. Lincoln believed in the Whig theory of the presidency, which left Congress to write the laws while he signed them, vetoing only those bills that threatened his war powers. Thus, he signed the Homestead Act in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in 1869. Other important legislation involved economic matters, including the first income tax and higher tariffs. Also included was the creation of the system of national banks by the National Banking Acts of 1863, 1864, and 1865, which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system.  Congress created and Lincoln approved the Department of Agriculture in 1862, although that institution would not become a Cabinet-level department until 1889.. The Legal Tender Act of 1862 established the United States Note, the first paper currency in United States history.  This was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.. During the war, Lincoln's Treasury Department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied South—the most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.. In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope, to put down the \"Sioux Uprising\" in Minnesota. Presented with 303 death warrants for convicted Santee Dakota who had massacred innocent farmers, Lincoln affirmed 39 of these for execution (one was later reprieved).. The assassination of Abraham Lincoln. From left to right: Henry Rathbone, Clara Harris, Mary Todd Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth. Originally, John Wilkes Booth, a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland, had formulated a plan to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and determined to assassinate the president. Harrison, Lowell Hayes, Lincoln of Kentucky, University Press of Kentucky, 2000, pp. 3–4. ISBN 0813121566.  Learning that the President and First Lady, together with the Grants, would be attending Ford's Theatre, he laid his plans, assigning his co-conspirators to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward.. Without his main bodyguard Ward Hill Lamon, to whom he related his famous dream regarding his own assassination, Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14, 1865. As a lone bodyguard wandered, and Lincoln sat in his state box (Box 7) in the balcony, Booth crept up behind the President and waited for the funniest line of the play, hoping the laughter would muffle the noise of the gunshot. When the laughter began, Booth jumped into the box and aimed a single-shot, round-slug .44 caliber Henry Deringer at his head, firing at point-blank range. Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth but was cut by Booth's knife. Booth then leapt to the stage and shouted \"Sic semper tyrannis!\" (Latin: \"Thus always to tyrants\") and escaped, despite a broken leg suffered in the leap. George Alfred Townsend, The Life, Crime and Capture of John Wilkes Booth. New York: Dick &amp; Fitzgerald, 1865. (LCCN  12002580.  A twelve-day manhunt ensued, in which Booth was chased by Federal agents (under the direction of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton). He was eventually cornered in a Virginia barn house  and shot, dying of his wounds soon after.. An army surgeon, Doctor Charles Leale, initially assessed Lincoln's wound as mortal. The President was taken across the street from the theater to the Petersen House, where he lay in a coma for nine hours before he died. Several physicians attended Lincoln, including U.S. Army Surgeon General Joseph K. Barnes of the Army Medical Museum. Using a probe, Barnes located some fragments of Lincoln's skull and the ball lodged 6 inches (15 cm) inside his brain. Lincoln never regained consciousness and was officially pronounced dead at 7:22:10 a.m. April 15, 1865 at the age of 56. There is some disagreement among historians as to Stanton's words after Lincoln died. All agree that he began \"Now he belongs to the...\" with some stating he said \"ages\" while others believe he said \"angels.\"  After Lincoln's body was returned to the White House, his body was prepared for his lying in repose in the East Room. He was the first president to lie in state.. The Army Medical Museum, now named the National Museum of Health and Medicine, has retained in its collection several artifacts relating to the assassination. Currently on display are the bullet that was fired from the Derringer pistol, the probe used by Barnes, pieces of Lincoln's skull and hair, and the surgeon's cuff stained with Lincoln's blood.. Lincoln's funeral train carried his remains, as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son William, 1,654 miles (2,661 km) to Illinois . Lincoln's body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to Illinois.  While much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the United States, Copperheads celebrated the death of a man they considered an unconstitutional tyrant. The Lincoln Tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, is 177 feet (54 m) tall and, by 1874, was surmounted with several bronze statues of Lincoln. To prevent repeated attempts to steal Lincoln's body and hold it for ransom, Robert Todd Lincoln had Lincoln exhumed and reinterred in concrete several feet thick in 1901.. With over 120 photographs taken of him, Lincoln was the most photographed man in the United States up to the time he was assassinated.. Lincoln was known for appointing political rivals to high positions in his cabinet to keep in line all factions of his party — and to let them battle each other and not combine against Lincoln. Historians agree that except for Simon Cameron, it was a highly effective group.. Abraham Lincoln's official White House portrait. Lincoln appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States:. In March 1860 in a speech in New Haven, Connecticut, Lincoln said, with respect to slavery, “Whenever this question shall be settled, it must be settled on some philosophical basis. No policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained.\" The philosophical basis for Lincoln’s beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that Lincoln be examined \"seriously as a man of ideas.\" Lincoln was a strong supporter of the American Whig version of liberal capitalism who, more than most politicians of the time, was able to express his ideas within the context of Nineteenth Century religious beliefs. Guelzo pg. 18-19. There were few people who strongly or directly influenced Lincoln’s moral and intellectual development and perspectives. There was no teacher, mentor, church leader, community leader, or peer that Lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. Lacking a formal education, Lincoln’s personal philosophy was shaped by \"an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning.\" It was Lincoln’s reading, rather than his relationships, that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs. Guelzo pg. 20. Miller pg. 57-59  Lincoln’s reading and study of the Bible was an integral part of his intellectual roots.. Lincoln did, even as a boy, largely reject organized religion, but the Calvinistic \"doctrine of necessity\" would remain a factor throughout his life. In 1846 Lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as \"that the human mind is impelled to action, or held in rest by some power, over which the mind itself has no control.\" Donald pg. 15. The quote came from a letter to the public in which Lincoln was denying charges by a political opponent that he was a “religious scoffer.”  In April 1864, in justifying his actions in regard to Emancipation, Lincoln wrote, \"I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of three years struggle the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. God alone can claim it.\" Donald pg. 514. As Lincoln matured, and especially during his term as president, the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. On a personal level, the death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace. Wilson pg. 251-254  After Willie’s death, in the summer or early fall of 1862, Lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary:. Lincoln’s religious skepticism was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the Lockean Enlightenment and classical liberalism, especially economic liberalism. Guelzo pg. 20  Consistent with the common practice of the Whig party, Lincoln would often use the Declaration of Independence as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies. Guelzo pg.194  In a February 22, 1861 speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia Lincoln said,. He found in the Declaration justification for Whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the nativist platform of the Know Nothings. In claiming that all men were created free, Lincoln and the Whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement, expanded education, territory to grow, and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population. Guelzo pg.194-195. It was the Declaration of Independence, rather than the Bible, that Lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. He saw the Declaration as more than a political document. To him, as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders, it was, foremost, a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation. Miller pg. 297. While Lincoln is usually portrayed bearded, he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year-old Grace Bedell. Lincoln's death made the President a martyr to many. Repeated polls of historians have ranked Lincoln as among the greatest presidents in U.S. history, often appearing in the first position. Among contemporary admirers, Lincoln is usually seen as personifying classical values of honesty and integrity, as well as respect for individual and minority rights, and human freedom in general.. Many American organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image, with interests ranging from the gay rights-supporting Log Cabin Republicans to the insurance corporation Lincoln National Corporation. The Lincoln automobile is also named after him. The ballistic missile submarine Abraham Lincoln (SSBN-602) and the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) were named in his honor. Also, the Liberty ship, SS Nancy Hanks was named to honor his mother. During the Spanish Civil War the American faction of the International Brigades named themselves the Abraham Lincoln Brigade after Lincoln.. Lincoln has been memorialized in many city names, notably the capital of Nebraska. Lincoln, Illinois, is the only city to be named for Abraham Lincoln before he became President. Lincoln's name and image appear in numerous places. These include the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., the U.S. Lincoln $5 bill and the Lincoln cent, Lincoln's sculpture on the Mount Rushmore, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois. In addition, New Salem, Illinois (a reconstruction of Lincoln's early adult hometown), Ford's Theatre, and Petersen House (where he died) are all preserved as museums. The Lincoln Shrine in Redlands, California, is located behind the A.K. Smiley Public Library. The state nickname for Illinois is Land of Lincoln.. Counties in 19 U.S. states (Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) are named after Lincoln.. Abraham Lincoln's birthday, February 12, was formerly a national holiday, now commemorated as Presidents' Day. However, it is still observed in Illinois and many other states as a separate legal holiday, Lincoln's Birthday. A dozen states have legal holidays celebrating the third Monday in February as 'Presidents' Day' as a combination Washington-Lincoln Day.. To commemorate his upcoming 200th birthday in February 2009, Congress established the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission (ALBC) in 2000. Dedicated to renewing American appreciation of Lincoln’s legacy, the 15-member commission is made up of lawmakers and scholars and also features an adivsory board of over 130 various Lincoln historians and enthusiasts. Located at Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., the ALBC is the organizing force behind numerous tributes, programs and cultural events highlighting a two-year celebration scheduled to begin in February 2008 at Lincoln’s birthplace:  Hodgenville, Kentucky.. Lincoln's birthplace and family home are national historic memorials: the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site in Hodgenville, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois.

              "      <td>Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the sixteenth President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1861 until his assassination. As an outspoken opponent of the expansion of slavery in the United States, \"[I]n his short autobiography written for the 1860 presidential campaign, Lincoln would describe his protest in the Illinois legislature as one that 'briefly defined his position on the slavery question, and so far as it goes, it was then the same that it is now.\" This was in reference to the anti-expansion sentiments he had then expressed. Doris Kearns Goodwin, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln (2005) p. 91.  Holzer pg. 232.  Writing of the Cooper Union  speech, Holzer notes, \"Cooper Union proved a unique confluence of political culture, rhetorical opportunity, technological innovation, and human genius, and it brought Abraham Lincoln to the center stage of American politics at precisely the right time and place, and with precisely the right message: that slavery was wrong, and ought to be confined to the areas where it already existed, and placed on the 'course of ultimate extinction... .'\"  Lincoln won the Republican Party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year. During his term, he helped preserve the United States by leading the defeat of the secessionist Confederate States of America in the American Civil War. He introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery, issuing his Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1865.. Lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including Ulysses S. Grant. Historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the Republican Party well, bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. Lincoln successfully defused a war scare with the United Kingdom in 1861. Under his leadership, the Union took control of the border slave states at the start of the war. Additionally, he managed his own reelection in the 1864 presidential election.. Opponents of the war (also known as \"Copperheads\") criticized him for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans, an abolitionist faction of the Republican Party, criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. Even with these problems, Lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches; his Gettysburg Address is but one example of this. At the close of the war, Lincoln held a moderate view of Reconstruction, seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. His assassination in 1865 was the first presidential assassination in U.S. history and made him a martyr for the ideal of national unity.. Scholars now rank Lincoln among the top three U.S. Presidents, with the majority of those surveyed placing him first. He is noted for his lasting influence on U.S. politics, including a redefinition of republicanism.  As Diggins explains, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.\" John Patrick Diggins, The Lost Soul of American Politics: Virtue, Self-interest, and the Foundations of Liberalism (1986) p. 307. Foner (1970) p. 215 noted that, \"Lincoln stressed the moral basis of Republicanism.\" Jaffa (2000) p. 399, stresses Lincoln's emphasis on the Declaration of Independence as what Lincoln called the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism. See also McPherson (1992) pp.61-64.. Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, to Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks, two uneducated farmers. Lincoln was born in a one-room log cabin on the   Sinking Spring Farm, in southeast Hardin County, Kentucky (now part of LaRue County). This area was at the time considered the \"frontier.\" The name \"Abraham\" was chosen to commemorate his grandfather, who was killed in an American Indian raid in 1786. Donald (1995) p 21  His elder sister, Sarah Lincoln, was born in 1807; a younger brother, Thomas Jr, died in infancy. It is sometimes debated whether Lincoln had Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of the connective tissue characterized by long limbs and great physical stature.  Marfan syndrome: Introduction Aug 1, 2006. Symbolic log cabin at Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site.. For some time, Thomas Lincoln was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the Kentucky back country. He had purchased the Sinking Spring Farm in December of 1808 for $200 cash and assumption of a debt.  The farm site is now preserved as part of Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site.  The family belonged to a Baptist church that had seceded from a larger church over the issue of slavery. Though Lincoln was exposed to his parents' anti-slavery sentiment from a very young age, he never joined their church, or any other church for that matter.  As a youth he had little use for religion. Life of Abraham Lincoln, Colonel Ward H. Lamon, 1872 - portions reprinted in  Chapter VIII: Abraham Lincoln, Deist, and Admirer of Thomas Paine, From the book Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents by Franklin Steiner (1936). Lincoln was just seven years old when, in 1816, the family was forced to make a new start in Perry County (now in Spencer County), Indiana. He later noted that this move was \"partly on account of slavery,\" and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in Kentucky: Unlike land in the Northwest Territory, Kentucky never had a proper U.S. survey, and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property. Lincoln was only nine when his mother, then thirty-four years old, died of milk sickness. Soon afterwards, his father remarried  to Sarah Bush Johnston. Sarah Lincoln raised young Lincoln like one of her own children. Years later she compared Lincoln to her own son, saying \"Both were good boys, but I must say — both now being dead that Abe was the best boy I ever saw or ever expect to see.\" Lincoln was affectionate toward his stepmother, whom he would call \"Mother\" for the rest of his life, but he was distant from his father.  Donald, (1995) pp. 28, 152.. In 1830, after more economic and land-title difficulties in Indiana, the family settled on public land  /ref&gt; in Macon County, Illinois. Some scholars believe that it was his father's repeated land-title difficulties and ensuing financial hardships that led young Lincoln to study law.  The following winter was desolate and especially brutal, and the family considered moving back to Indiana. The following year, when his father relocated the family to a new homestead in Coles County, Illinois, twenty-two-year-old Lincoln struck out on his own, canoeing down the Sangamon River to the village of New Salem in Sangamon County. Later that year, hired by New Salem businessman Denton Offutt and accompanied by friends, he took goods from New Salem to New Orleans via flatboat on the Sangamon, Illinois and Mississippi rivers. While in New Orleans, he may have witnessed a slave auction, though as a frequent visitor to Kentucky, he would have had several earlier opportunities to witness  similar sales.  Donald, (1995) ch. 2.. Lincoln's formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling. Largely self-educated, he read every book he could get his hands on, once walking.  just to borrow one  While his favorite book was The Life of George Washington, Lincoln mastered the Bible, Shakespeare, and English and American history, and developed a plain writing style that puzzled audiences more used to grandiose rhetoric. He was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an ax; some rails he had allegedly split in his youth were exhibited at the 1860 Republican National Convention, as the party celebrated the poor-boy-made-good theme. Lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals, even for food. Though he was unusually tall at  , 4 inches and strong, Lincoln spent so much time reading that some neighbors suspected he must be doing it to avoid strenuous manual labor.. Young Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln began his political career in 1832, at age 23, with an unsuccessful campaign for the Illinois General Assembly, as a member of the Whig Party.  He ran eighth in a field of 13 candidates.  The centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the Sangamon River. He believed that this would attract steamboat traffic, which would allow the sparsely populated, poorer areas along the river to flourish.. He was elected captain of an Illinois militia company drawn from New Salem during the Black Hawk War, and later wrote that he had not had \"any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction.\"  Thomas (1952) 32-34; Basler (1946) p. 551   Though he never saw combat, Lincoln did assist in burying the dead from the Battle of Stillman's Run the day after Major Isaiah Stillman's troops fled the field of battle.  Abraham Lincoln Online Retrieved on March 11, 2007. For several months, Lincoln ran a small store in New Salem, selling tea, coffee, sugar, salt, blue calico, brown muslin, straw hats and whiskey.  Beveridge (1928) 1:127-8  Later, he found work as village postmaster and as a surveyor.. In 1834, he won election to the state legislature, and after coming across the Commentaries on the Laws of England, began to teach himself law. Admitted to the bar in 1837, he moved to Springfield, Illinois, that same year and began to practice law with John T. Stuart. With a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and in his closing arguments, Lincoln became one of the most respected and successful lawyers in Illinois and grew steadily more prosperous.. He served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a representative from Sangamon County, and became a leader of the Illinois Whig party. In 1837, he made his first protest against slavery in the Illinois House, stating that the institution was \"founded on both injustice and bad policy.\"  Protest in Illinois Legislature on Slavery, p.75, March 3, 1837  It was also in this same year that Lincoln met Joshua Fry Speed, who would become his most intimate friend.. Lincoln wrote a series of anonymous letters, published in 1842 in the Sangamon Journal, mocking State Auditor and prominent Democrat James Shields. Shields would later become a U.S. senator, but when he learned that it was Lincoln who had been writing the barbs, he challenged him to a duel. As Shields was the challenger, Lincoln was granted the right to choose the weapon and specified \"Cavalry broad swords of the largest size.\" Much taller and with long arms, this gave him an overwhelming advantage over his opponent; however, the duel was called off at the last minute. Beveridge (1928) 1:349. Lincoln had been practicing with the broad sword.  Two years later, Lincoln entered law practice with William Herndon, a fellow Whig. In 1854, both men joined the fledgling Republican Party. Following Lincoln's death, Herndon began collecting stories about Lincoln and published them in Herndon's Lincoln.. The first photograph ever taken of Mary Lincoln, a daguerreotype by Shepherd in 1846.. On November 4 1842 Lincoln married Mary Todd, daughter of a prominent slave-owning family from Kentucky. The couple had four sons. Robert Todd Lincoln was born in Springfield, Illinois on 1 August, 1843. Their only child to survive into adulthood, young Robert attended Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard College. Robert died on July 26, 1926, in Manchester, Vermont.. The other Lincoln children were born in Springfield, Illinois, and died either during childhood or their teen years. Edward Baker Lincoln was born on March 10, 1846, and died on 1 February, 1850, also in Springfield. William Wallace Lincoln was born on December 21, 1850, and died on February 20, 1862 in Washington, D.C., during Pres. Lincoln's first term. Thomas \"Tad\" Lincoln was born on 4 April, 1853, and died on July 16, 1871 in Chicago.. Four of his wife's brothers fought for the Confederacy, with one wounded and another killed in action. Lieutenant David H. Todd, a half-brother of Mary Todd Lincoln, served as commandant of the Libby Prison camp during the war.. The first photograph ever taken of Abraham Lincoln, a daguerreotype taken by Shepherd in 1846.. A Whig and an admirer of party leader Henry Clay,  Lincoln was elected to a term in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1846. As a freshman House member, he was not a particularly powerful or influential figure. He spoke out against the Mexican-American War, which he attributed to President Polk's desire for \"military glory — that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood.\" He also challenged the President's claims regarding the Texas boundary and offered Spot Resolutions demanding to know on what \"spot\" on US soil that blood was first spilt.  Congressional Globe, 30th Session (1848) pp.93-95  In January of 1848, he was among the 82 Whigs who defeated 81 Democrats in a procedural vote on an amendment to send a routine resolution back to committee with instructions to add the words \"a war unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the President of the United States.\" The amendment passed, but the bill never reemerged from committee and was never finally voted upon.  House Journal, 30th Session (1848) pp.183-184. Lincoln later damaged his political reputation with a speech in which he declared, \"God of Heaven has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent, and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men, women, and children, and lay waste and pillage the land of the just.\" Two weeks later, President Polk sent a peace treaty to Congress. While no one in Washington paid any attention to Lincoln, the Democrats orchestrated angry outbursts from across his district, where the war was popular and many had volunteered. In Morgan County, resolutions were adopted in fervent support of the war and in wrathful denunciation of the \"treasonable assaults of guerrillas at home; party demagogues; slanderers of the President; defenders of the butchery at the Alamo; traducers of the heroism at San Jacinto.\"  Abe Lincoln resource page. Warned by his law partner, William Herndon, that the damage was mounting and irreparable, Lincoln decided not to run for reelection. In fact, in 1848 he campaigned vigorously for Zachary Taylor, the successful general whose atrocities he had denounced in January. Regardless, his statements were not easily forgotten, and would haunt him during the Civil War. These statements were also held against him when he applied for a position in the new Taylor administration. Instead, Taylor's people offered Lincoln various positions in the remote Oregon Territory, primarily the governorship. Acceptance of this offer would have ended his career in the rapidly growing state of Illinois, so Lincoln declined the position. Returning to Springfield, Lincoln gave up politics for several years and turned his energies to his law practice. During this time, he made many trips on horseback between various counties' courthouses. Beveridge, (1928) 1: 428-33; Donald (1995) p. 140-43.. In the 1920s historical markers were placed at the county lines along the route Lincoln traveled in the eight judicial district. This example is on the border of Piatt and DeWitt counties. By the mid-1850s, Lincoln's caseload focused largely on the competing transportation interests of river barges and railroads. In one prominent 1851 case, he represented the Alton &amp; Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with a shareholder, James A. Barret. Barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to the railroad on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. Lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest, that the newer route proposed by Alton &amp; Sangamon was superior and less expensive, and that accordingly, the corporation had a right to sue Barret for his delinquent payment. He won this case, and the decision by the Illinois Supreme Court was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the United States. Donald, (1995) ch. 6.. Possibly the most notable criminal trial of Lincoln's career as a lawyer came in 1858, when he defended William \"Duff\" Armstrong, who has been charged with murder. The case became famous for Lincoln's use of judicial notice--a rare tactic at that time--to show that an eyewitness had lied on the stand. After the witness testified to having seen the crime by moonlight, Lincoln produced a Farmers' Almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle that it could not have provided enough illumination to see anything clearly. Based almost entirely on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted. Donald (1995), 150-51. Lincoln was involved in more than 5,100 cases in Illinois alone during his 23-year legal career. Though many of these cases involved little more than filing a writ, others were more substantial and quite involved. Lincoln and his partners appeared before the Illinois State Supreme Court more than 400 times. During one trial, Lincoln's voir dire included a question to prospective jurors as to whether they were acquainted with counsel for the other side. When a few of them turned out to know the other lawyer, the judge interrupted, saying, \"Mr. Lincoln, you are wasting the time of the court. The fact that a prospective juror knows your opponent does not disqualify him.\". \"No, Your Honor, I understand that,\" Lincoln answered. \"I'm afraid that some of them might not know him, which would place me at a disadvantage.\". Lincoln returned to politics in response to the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854), which expressly repealed the limits on slavery's extent as determined by the Missouri Compromise (1820). Illinois Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, the most powerful man in the Senate, proposed popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse, and incorporated it into the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory, rather than have such a decision imposed on them by Congress.  Donald, (1995) ch. 7.. In a speech against the act, on October 16 1854, delivered in Peoria, Lincoln first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day:. Drawing on remnants of the old Whig, Free Soil, Liberty and Democratic parties, he was instrumental in forming the new Republican Party. In a stirring campaign, the Republicans carried Illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. Lincoln was the obvious choice, but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an ex-Democrat Lyman Trumbull.. In 1857-58, Douglas broke with President Buchanan, leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state. Accepting the Republican nomination for Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered his famous speech: \"'A house divided against itself cannot stand.'(Mark 3:25) I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.\"  A House Divided Against Itself Cannot Stand, June 1858  The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the north.. The 1858 campaign featured the Lincoln-Douglas debates, a nationally famous contest on slavery. Lincoln warned that the \"Slave Power\" was threatening the values of republicanism, while Douglas emphasized the supremacy of democracy, as set forth in his Freeport Doctrine, which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not. Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature reelected Douglas to the Senate. Nevertheless, Lincoln's eloquence transformed him into a national political star.. During the debates of 1858, the issue of race was often discussed. During a time period when few believed in racial egalitarianism, Stephen Douglas informed the crowds, \"If you desire Negro citizenship… if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves… then support Mr. Lincoln and the Black Republican party, who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro.\"  First Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Ottawa, Illinois, August 21, 1858  Lincoln countered that he was \"not in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races.\"  Fourth Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Charleston, Illinois, September 18, 1858  His opposition to slavery was opposition to the Slave Power, though this would change during the course of the Civil War. Donald, (1995) ch. 8.. On May 9-10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur. At this convention, Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.. \"The Rail Candidate,\" Lincoln's 1860 candidacy is held up by slavery issue (slave on left) and party organization (New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley on right). Photo of Lincoln taken February 27, 1860 in New York City by Mathew Brady, the day of his famous Cooper Union speech.. Entering the presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog, Lincoln was eventually chosen as the Republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. His expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase. His \"Western\" origins also appealed to the newer states: other contenders, especially those with more governmental experience, had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states, while Lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the West. Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government. Yet despite his Southern connections (his in-laws owned slaves), Lincoln misunderstood the depth of the revolution underway in the South and the emergence of Southern nationalism. Throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war, and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession.  Gabor S. Boritt, \"'And the War Came'? Abraham Lincoln and the Question of Individual Responsibility,\" Why the Civil War Came ed by Boritt (1996), pp 3-30.. Throughout the election, Lincoln did not campaign or give speeches. This was handled by the state and county Republican organizations, who used the latest techniques to sustain party enthusiasm and thus obtain high turnout. There was little effort to convert non-Republicans, and there was virtually no campaigning in the South except for a few border cities such as St. Louis, Missouri, and Wheeling, Virginia; indeed, the party did not even run a slate in most of the South. In the North, there were thousands of Republican speakers, tons of campaign posters and leaflets, and thousands of newspaper editorials. These focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, making the most of his boyhood poverty, his pioneer background, his native genius, and his rise from obscurity. His nicknames, \"Honest Abe\" and \"the Rail-Splitter,\" were exploited to the full. The goal was to emphasize the superior power of \"free labor,\" whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts.  Thomas (1952) p 216; Reinhard H. Luthin, The First Lincoln Campaign (1944); Nevins vol 4;. On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, John C. Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and John Bell of the new Constitutional Union Party. He was the first Republican president, winning entirely on the strength of his support in the North: he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the South, and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other Southern states. Lincoln gained 1,865,908 votes (39.9% of the total), for 180 electoral votes; Douglas, 1,380,202 (29.5%) for 12 electoral votes; Breckenridge, 848,019 (18.1%) for 72 electoral votes; and Bell, 590,901 (12.5%) for 39 electoral votes. There were fusion tickets in some states, but even if his opponents had combined in every state, Lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election.. As Lincoln's election became more likely, secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the Union. South Carolina took the lead, followed by six other cotton-growing states in the deep South. The upper South (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to and rejected the secessionist appeal. They decided to stay in the Union, though they warned Lincoln that they would not support an invasion through their territory. The seven Confederate states seceded before Lincoln took office, declaring themselves to be a new nation, the Confederate States of America. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy.. President-elect Lincoln evaded possible assassins in Baltimore, and on February 23, 1861, arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C. At his inauguration on March 4, 1861, the German American Turners formed Lincoln's bodyguard; and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present, ready to protect the capital from Confederate invasion and local insurrection.. Photograph showing the March 4, 1861, inauguration of Abraham Lincoln in front of United States Capitol.. In his First Inaugural Address, Lincoln declared, \"I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments,\" arguing further that the purpose of the United States Constitution was \"to form a more perfect union\" than the Articles of Confederation which were explicitly perpetual, thus the Constitution too was perpetual. He asked rhetorically that even were the Constitution a simple contract, would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?. Also in his inaugural address, in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war, Lincoln supported the pending Corwin Amendment to the Constitution, which had already passed Congress. This amendment, which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it existed, was designed to appeal not to the Confederacy but to the critical border states. At the same time, Lincoln adamantly opposed the Crittenden Compromise, which would have permitted slavery in the territories. Despite support for the Crittenden compromise among some prominent Republicans (including William Seward), Lincoln denounced it saying that it \"would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people, tribe, and state owning a foot of land between here and Tierra del Fuego.\". By the time Lincoln took office, the Confederacy was an established fact, and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. No compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. Lincoln might have allowed the southern states to secede, and some Republicans recommended that. However, conservative Democratic nationalists, such as Jeremiah S. Black, Joseph Holt, and Edwin M. Stanton had taken control of Buchanan's cabinet around January 1, 1861, and refused to accept secession. Lincoln and nearly every Republican leader adopted this position by March 1861: the Union could not be dismantled. However, as a strict follower of the constitution, Lincoln refused to take any action against the South unless the Unionists themselves were attacked first. This finally happened in April 1861.. Historian Allan Nevins argues that Lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the Union, hold government property, and still avoid war. He \"temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis,\" overestimated the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South and border states, and misunderstood the conditional support of Unionists in the border states.  Allan Nevins, The Improvised War, 1861-1862 (1959) p 29. In April 1861, after Union troops at Fort Sumter were fired upon and forced to surrender, Lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and \"preserve the Union,\" which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. Virginia, which had repeatedly warned Lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state, responded by seceding, along with North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas.. The slave states of Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware did not secede, and Lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there, promising not to interfere with slavery. After the fighting started, he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas (especially in Maryland) and held in military prisons without trial. Over 18,000 were arrested, though none were executed. One, Clement Vallandigham, was exiled; but all of the remainder were released, usually after two or three months (see: Ex parte Merryman).. Lincoln met with his cabinet for the first reading of the Emancipation Proclamation draft on July 22, 1862. L-R: Edwin M. Stanton, Salmon P. Chase, Abraham Lincoln, Gideon Welles, Caleb B. Smith, William H. Seward, Montgomery Blair and Edward Bates. In July 1862, Congress moved to free the slaves by passing the Second Confiscation Act. The goal was to weaken the rebellion, which was led and controlled by slave owners. While it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery (the Thirteenth Amendment did that), the Act showed that Lincoln had the support of Congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. This new law was implemented with Lincoln's \"Emancipation Proclamation.\". Lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the United States. In 1861 – 1862, however, he made it clear that the North was fighting the war to preserve the Union, not to abolish slavery. Freeing the slaves became, in late 1862, a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. Abolitionists criticized Lincoln for his sluggishness over slavery per se, but on August 22, 1862, Lincoln explained:. The Emancipation Proclamation, announced on September 22 and put into effect on January 1, 1863, freed slaves in territories not under Union control. As Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all of them in Confederate hands (over three million) were freed. Lincoln later said: \"I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.\" The proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. Lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation. Lincoln addressed the issue of his consistency in an 1864 letter to Albert G. Hodges.  Letter to Albert G. Hodges, April 4, 1864. In September 1862, thirteen northern governors met in Altoona, Pennsylvania, at the Loyal War Governors' Conference to discuss the Proclamation and Union war effort. In the end, the state executives fully supported the president's Proclamation and also suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union's Army of the Potomac.  Images of America: Altoona, by Sr. Anne Francis Pulling, 2001, 10.. For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. As Frederick Douglass observed, Lincoln was, \"The first great man that I talked with in the United States freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself, of the difference of color.\" Life and Times of Frederick Douglass, by Frederick Douglass, 1895. After Union victories at Gettysburg, Vicksburg and Chattanooga in 1863, victory seemed at hand, and Lincoln promoted Ulysses S. Grant General-in-Chief ( March 12, 1864). When the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates, Lincoln supported Grant's strategy of wearing down Lee's Confederate army at the cost of heavy Union casualties. With an election looming, he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. At the Convention, the Republican Party selected Andrew Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. They ran on the new Union Party ticket uniting Republicans and War Democrats.. Lincoln, in top hat, with Allan Pinkerton and Gen. John Alexander McClernand at Antietam.. Nevertheless, Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Acknowledging this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would nonetheless defeat the Confederacy by an all-out military effort before turning over the White House: Mark Grimsley and Brooks D Simpson, eds. The Collapse of the Confederacy (2001) p 80. Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.. While the Democratic platform followed the Peace wing of the party and called the war a \"failure,\" their candidate, General George B. McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform.. Lincoln provided Grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to support Grant and win local support for the war effort. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September ended defeatist jitters; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln; the Union party was united and energized, and Lincoln was easily reelected in a landslide. He won all but two states, capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.. On March 4 1865, Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address, his favorite of all his speeches. At this time, a victory over the rebels was at hand, slavery was dead, and Lincoln was looking to the future.. “Running the ‘Machine’”. An 1864 cartoon featuring Lincoln, William Fessenden, Edwin Stanton, William Seward and Gideon Welles takes a swing at the Lincoln administration. The war was a source of constant frustration for the president, and occupied nearly all of his time. He had a contentious relationship with General McClellan, who became general-in-chief of all the Union armies in the wake of the embarrassing Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run and after the retirement of Winfield Scott in late 1861. Despite his inexperience in military affairs, Lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. His priorities were twofold: to ensure that Washington, D.C., was well defended; and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the Northern public and press. McClellan, a youthful West Point graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service, took a more cautious approach. He took several months to plan and execute his Peninsula Campaign, with the objective of capturing Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula between the James and York Rivers. McClellan's delay irritated Lincoln, as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend Washington, D.C. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops to defend the capital, a decision McClellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.. McClellan, a lifelong Democrat who was temperamentally conservative, was relieved as general-in-chief after releasing his Harrison's Landing Letter, where he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint John Pope, a Republican, as head of the new Army of Virginia. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack. But Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. In response to his failure, Pope was sent to Minnesota to fight the Sioux.. An 1864 Mathew Brady photo depicts President Lincoln reading a book with his youngest son, Tad. Panicked by Lee's invasion of Maryland, Lincoln restored McClellan to command of all forces around Washington in time for the Battle of Antietam (September 1862). The ensuing Union victory enabled Lincoln to release his Emancipation Proclamation, but he relieved McClellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed Republican Ambrose Burnside to head the Army of the Potomac. Burnside had promised to follow through on Lincoln's strategic vision for a strong offensive against Lee and Richmond. After Burnside was stunningly defeated at Fredericksburg, Joseph Hooker was given the command, despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders.  Joseph Hooker biography  Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville (May 1863), and relieved of command early in the subsequent Gettysburg Campaign replaced by George Meade.. After the Union victory at Gettysburg, Meade's failure to pursue Lee and months of inactivity for the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to bring in a western general, Ulysses S. Grant. Grant already had a solid string of victories in the Western Theater, including the battles of Vicksburg and Chattanooga. Responding to criticism of Grant, Lincoln was quoted as saying, \"I cannot spare this man. He fights.\" Grant waged his bloody Overland Campaign in 1864 with a strategy of a war of attrition, characterized by high Union losses at battles such as the Wilderness and Cold Harbor, but by proportionately higher Confederate losses. His invasion campaign eventually bottled Lee up in the Siege of Petersburg, so that Grant could take Richmond, and bring the war to a close in the spring of 1865.. Lincoln authorized Grant to target civilians and infrastructure, hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. This allowed Generals Sherman and Sheridan to destroy farms and towns in the Shenandoah Valley, Georgia, and South Carolina. The damage caused by Sherman's March to the Sea through Georgia totaled in excess of $100 million by Sherman's own estimate. See Hofstadter, Richard, The United States: The History of a Republic, Prentice-Hall, 1967, p. 446.. Lincoln had a star-crossed record as a military leader, possessing a keen understanding of strategic points (such as the Mississippi River and the fortress city of Vicksburg) and the importance of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing cities. He had, however, limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863, when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in Ulysses S. Grant. Only then could he insist on using African American troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.. Throughout the war, Lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. He spent hours at the War Department telegraph office, reading dispatches from his generals. He visited battle sites frequently, and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. During Jubal Anderson Early's raid on Washington, D.C. in 1864, Lincoln had to be told to duck to avoid being shot while observing the battle.. Reconstruction began during the war as Lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the Southern states and what to do with Confederate leaders and the freed slaves. Lincoln led the \"moderates\" regarding Reconstructionist policy, and was usually opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Thaddeus Stevens in the House and Charles Sumner and Benjamin Wade in the Senate (though he cooperated with these men on most other issues). Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind Union lines. His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.  /ref&gt; Critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. Of special importance were Tennessee, where Lincoln appointed Andrew Johnson as governor, and Louisiana, where Lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. The Radicals thought this policy too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864. When Lincoln pocket-vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.  Donald (1995) ch. 20. On April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House in Virginia, and the war was effectively over. The other rebel armies surrendered soon after, and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare. Lincoln went to Richmond to make a public gesture of sitting at Jefferson Davis's own desk, symbolically saying to the nation that the President of the United States held authority over the entire land. He was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves, whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer's quote, \"I know I am free for I have seen the face of Father Abraham and have felt him.\" When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, Lincoln replied, \"Let 'em up easy.\"  Donald (1995) 576, 580,   \"President Lincoln Enters Richmond, 1865\" EyeWitness to History, www.eywitnesstohistory.com (2000).. One of the last photographs of Lincoln, likely taken between February and April 1865. Lincoln's powerful rhetoric defined the issues of the war for the nation, the world, and posterity. His extraordinary command of the English language was evidenced in the Gettysburg Address, a speech dedicating the cemetery at Gettysburg that he delivered on November 19, 1863. The speech defied Lincoln's own prediction that \"the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here.\" Lincoln's second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted. In these speeches, Lincoln articulated better than anyone else the rationale behind the Union cause.. In recent years, historians have stressed Lincoln's use of and redefinition of republican values. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln shifted emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism.  Jaffa (2000) p. 399  The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, rather than the Constitution's tolerance of slavers, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.\"  John Patrick Diggins, The Lost Soul of American Politics: Virtue, Self-interest, and the Foundations of Liberalism (1986) p. 307.  His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.  Foner (1970) p. 215 says, \"Lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism.\"  See also McPherson (1992) pp.61-64.  Nevertheless, in 1861 Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a \"republican form of government\" in every state. Jaffa (2000) p. 263  That duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in Reconstruction.. Lincoln's second inauguration on March 4, 1865. In the photo, Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth, can be seen in the crowd at the top and accomplices David Herold, Lewis Powell, George Atzerodt, John Surratt and Edmund Spangler in the bottom crowd. In his Gettysburg Address Lincoln redefined the American nation, arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776, \"conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\" He declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality, \"that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\" By emphasizing the centrality of the nation, he rebuffed the claims of state sovereignty. While some critics say Lincoln moved too far and too fast,  H.L. Mencken said \"It is difficult to imagine anything more untrue. The Union soldiers in the battle actually fought against self-determination; it was the Confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves.\" Mencken did not mention the right of self-determination rights for blacks.   they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked \"a new founding of the nation.\"  Wills (1992) p. 39.. During the Civil War, Lincoln appropriated powers no previous President had wielded: he used his war powers to proclaim a blockade, suspended the writ of habeas corpus, spent money without congressional authorization, and imprisoned 18,000 suspected Confederate sympathizers without trial. Nearly all of his actions, although vehemently denounced by the Copperheads, were subsequently upheld by Congress and the Courts.. Lincoln believed in the Whig theory of the presidency, which left Congress to write the laws while he signed them, vetoing only those bills that threatened his war powers. Thus, he signed the Homestead Act in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in 1869. Other important legislation involved economic matters, including the first income tax and higher tariffs. Also included was the creation of the system of national banks by the National Banking Acts of 1863, 1864, and 1865, which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system.  Congress created and Lincoln approved the Department of Agriculture in 1862, although that institution would not become a Cabinet-level department until 1889.. The Legal Tender Act of 1862 established the United States Note, the first paper currency in United States history.  This was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.. During the war, Lincoln's Treasury Department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied South—the most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.. In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope, to put down the \"Sioux Uprising\" in Minnesota. Presented with 303 death warrants for convicted Santee Dakota who had massacred innocent farmers, Lincoln affirmed 39 of these for execution (one was later reprieved).. The assassination of Abraham Lincoln. From left to right: Henry Rathbone, Clara Harris, Mary Todd Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth. Originally, John Wilkes Booth, a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland, had formulated a plan to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and determined to assassinate the president. Harrison, Lowell Hayes, Lincoln of Kentucky, University Press of Kentucky, 2000, pp. 3–4. ISBN 0813121566.  Learning that the President and First Lady, together with the Grants, would be attending Ford's Theatre, he laid his plans, assigning his co-conspirators to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward.. Without his main bodyguard Ward Hill Lamon, to whom he related his famous dream regarding his own assassination, Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14, 1865. As a lone bodyguard wandered, and Lincoln sat in his state box (Box 7) in the balcony, Booth crept up behind the President and waited for the funniest line of the play, hoping the laughter would muffle the noise of the gunshot. When the laughter began, Booth jumped into the box and aimed a single-shot, round-slug .44 caliber Henry Deringer at his head, firing at point-blank range. Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth but was cut by Booth's knife. Booth then leapt to the stage and shouted \"Sic semper tyrannis!\" (Latin: \"Thus always to tyrants\") and escaped, despite a broken leg suffered in the leap. George Alfred Townsend, The Life, Crime and Capture of John Wilkes Booth. New York: Dick &amp; Fitzgerald, 1865. (LCCN  12002580.  A twelve-day manhunt ensued, in which Booth was chased by Federal agents (under the direction of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton). He was eventually cornered in a Virginia barn house  and shot, dying of his wounds soon after.. An army surgeon, Doctor Charles Leale, initially assessed Lincoln's wound as mortal. The President was taken across the street from the theater to the Petersen House, where he lay in a coma for nine hours before he died. Several physicians attended Lincoln, including U.S. Army Surgeon General Joseph K. Barnes of the Army Medical Museum. Using a probe, Barnes located some fragments of Lincoln's skull and the ball lodged 6 inches (15 cm) inside his brain. Lincoln never regained consciousness and was officially pronounced dead at 7:22:10 a.m. April 15, 1865 at the age of 56. There is some disagreement among historians as to Stanton's words after Lincoln died. All agree that he began \"Now he belongs to the...\" with some stating he said \"ages\" while others believe he said \"angels.\"  After Lincoln's body was returned to the White House, his body was prepared for his lying in repose in the East Room. He was the first president to lie in state.. The Army Medical Museum, now named the National Museum of Health and Medicine, has retained in its collection several artifacts relating to the assassination. Currently on display are the bullet that was fired from the Derringer pistol, the probe used by Barnes, pieces of Lincoln's skull and hair, and the surgeon's cuff stained with Lincoln's blood.. Lincoln's funeral train carried his remains, as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son William, 1,654 miles (2,661 km) to Illinois . Lincoln's body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to Illinois.  While much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the United States, Copperheads celebrated the death of a man they considered an unconstitutional tyrant. The Lincoln Tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, is 177 feet (54 m) tall and, by 1874, was surmounted with several bronze statues of Lincoln. To prevent repeated attempts to steal Lincoln's body and hold it for ransom, Robert Todd Lincoln had Lincoln exhumed and reinterred in concrete several feet thick in 1901.. With over 120 photographs taken of him, Lincoln was the most photographed man in the United States up to the time he was assassinated.. Lincoln was known for appointing political rivals to high positions in his cabinet to keep in line all factions of his party — and to let them battle each other and not combine against Lincoln. Historians agree that except for Simon Cameron, it was a highly effective group.. Abraham Lincoln's official White House portrait. Lincoln appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States:. In March 1860 in a speech in New Haven, Connecticut, Lincoln said, with respect to slavery, “Whenever this question shall be settled, it must be settled on some philosophical basis. No policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained.\" The philosophical basis for Lincoln’s beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that Lincoln be examined \"seriously as a man of ideas.\" Lincoln was a strong supporter of the American Whig version of liberal capitalism who, more than most politicians of the time, was able to express his ideas within the context of Nineteenth Century religious beliefs. Guelzo pg. 18-19. There were few people who strongly or directly influenced Lincoln’s moral and intellectual development and perspectives. There was no teacher, mentor, church leader, community leader, or peer that Lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. Lacking a formal education, Lincoln’s personal philosophy was shaped by \"an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning.\" It was Lincoln’s reading, rather than his relationships, that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs. Guelzo pg. 20. Miller pg. 57-59  Lincoln’s reading and study of the Bible was an integral part of his intellectual roots.. Lincoln did, even as a boy, largely reject organized religion, but the Calvinistic \"doctrine of necessity\" would remain a factor throughout his life. In 1846 Lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as \"that the human mind is impelled to action, or held in rest by some power, over which the mind itself has no control.\" Donald pg. 15. The quote came from a letter to the public in which Lincoln was denying charges by a political opponent that he was a “religious scoffer.”  In April 1864, in justifying his actions in regard to Emancipation, Lincoln wrote, \"I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of three years struggle the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. God alone can claim it.\" Donald pg. 514. As Lincoln matured, and especially during his term as president, the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. On a personal level, the death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace. Wilson pg. 251-254  After Willie’s death, in the summer or early fall of 1862, Lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary:. Lincoln’s religious skepticism was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the Lockean Enlightenment and classical liberalism, especially economic liberalism. Guelzo pg. 20  Consistent with the common practice of the Whig party, Lincoln would often use the Declaration of Independence as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies. Guelzo pg.194  In a February 22, 1861 speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia Lincoln said,. He found in the Declaration justification for Whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the nativist platform of the Know Nothings. In claiming that all men were created free, Lincoln and the Whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement, expanded education, territory to grow, and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population. Guelzo pg.194-195. It was the Declaration of Independence, rather than the Bible, that Lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. He saw the Declaration as more than a political document. To him, as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders, it was, foremost, a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation. Miller pg. 297. While Lincoln is usually portrayed bearded, he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year-old Grace Bedell. Lincoln's death made the President a martyr to many. Repeated polls of historians have ranked Lincoln as among the greatest presidents in U.S. history, often appearing in the first position. Among contemporary admirers, Lincoln is usually seen as personifying classical values of honesty and integrity, as well as respect for individual and minority rights, and human freedom in general.. Many American organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image, with interests ranging from the gay rights-supporting Log Cabin Republicans to the insurance corporation Lincoln National Corporation. The Lincoln automobile is also named after him. The ballistic missile submarine Abraham Lincoln (SSBN-602) and the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) were named in his honor. Also, the Liberty ship, SS Nancy Hanks was named to honor his mother. During the Spanish Civil War the American faction of the International Brigades named themselves the Abraham Lincoln Brigade after Lincoln.. Lincoln has been memorialized in many city names, notably the capital of Nebraska. Lincoln, Illinois, is the only city to be named for Abraham Lincoln before he became President. Lincoln's name and image appear in numerous places. These include the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., the U.S. Lincoln $5 bill and the Lincoln cent, Lincoln's sculpture on the Mount Rushmore, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois. In addition, New Salem, Illinois (a reconstruction of Lincoln's early adult hometown), Ford's Theatre, and Petersen House (where he died) are all preserved as museums. The Lincoln Shrine in Redlands, California, is located behind the A.K. Smiley Public Library. The state nickname for Illinois is Land of Lincoln.. Counties in 19 U.S. states (Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) are named after Lincoln.. Abraham Lincoln's birthday, February 12, was formerly a national holiday, now commemorated as Presidents' Day. However, it is still observed in Illinois and many other states as a separate legal holiday, Lincoln's Birthday. A dozen states have legal holidays celebrating the third Monday in February as 'Presidents' Day' as a combination Washington-Lincoln Day.. To commemorate his upcoming 200th birthday in February 2009, Congress established the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission (ALBC) in 2000. Dedicated to renewing American appreciation of Lincoln’s legacy, the 15-member commission is made up of lawmakers and scholars and also features an adivsory board of over 130 various Lincoln historians and enthusiasts. Located at Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., the ALBC is the organizing force behind numerous tributes, programs and cultural events highlighting a two-year celebration scheduled to begin in February 2008 at Lincoln’s birthplace:  Hodgenville, Kentucky.. Lincoln's birthplace and family home are national historic memorials: the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site in Hodgenville, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois.

As an outspoken opponent of the expansion of slavery in the United States, \"[I]n his short autobiography written for the 1860 presidential campaign, Lincoln would describe his protest in the Illinois legislature as one that 'briefly defined his position on the slavery question, and so far as it goes, it was then the same that it is now.\" This was in reference to the anti-expansion sentiments he had then expressed. Doris Kearns Goodwin, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln (2005) p. 91.  Holzer pg. 232.  Writing of the Cooper Union  speech, Holzer notes, \"Cooper Union proved a unique confluence of political culture, rhetorical opportunity, technological innovation, and human genius, and it brought Abraham Lincoln to the center stage of American politics at precisely the right time and place, and with precisely the right message: that slavery was wrong, and ought to be confined to the areas where it already existed, and placed on the 'course of ultimate extinction... .'\"  Lincoln won the Republican Party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year. During his term, he helped preserve the United States by leading the defeat of the secessionist Confederate States of America in the American Civil War. He introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery, issuing his Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1865.. Lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including Ulysses S. Grant. Historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the Republican Party well, bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. Lincoln successfully defused a war scare with the United Kingdom in 1861. Under his leadership, the Union took control of the border slave states at the start of the war. Additionally, he managed his own reelection in the 1864 presidential election.. Opponents of the war (also known as \"Copperheads\") criticized him for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans, an abolitionist faction of the Republican Party, criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. Even with these problems, Lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches; his Gettysburg Address is but one example of this. At the close of the war, Lincoln held a moderate view of Reconstruction, seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. His assassination in 1865 was the first presidential assassination in U.S. history and made him a martyr for the ideal of national unity.. Scholars now rank Lincoln among the top three U.S. Presidents, with the majority of those surveyed placing him first. He is noted for his lasting influence on U.S. politics, including a redefinition of republicanism.  As Diggins explains, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.\" John Patrick Diggins, The Lost Soul of American Politics: Virtue, Self-interest, and the Foundations of Liberalism (1986) p. 307. Foner (1970) p. 215 noted that, \"Lincoln stressed the moral basis of Republicanism.\" Jaffa (2000) p. 399, stresses Lincoln's emphasis on the Declaration of Independence as what Lincoln called the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism. See also McPherson (1992) pp.61-64.. Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, to Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks, two uneducated farmers. Lincoln was born in a one-room log cabin on the   Sinking Spring Farm, in southeast Hardin County, Kentucky (now part of LaRue County). This area was at the time considered the \"frontier.\" The name \"Abraham\" was chosen to commemorate his grandfather, who was killed in an American Indian raid in 1786. Donald (1995) p 21  His elder sister, Sarah Lincoln, was born in 1807; a younger brother, Thomas Jr, died in infancy. It is sometimes debated whether Lincoln had Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of the connective tissue characterized by long limbs and great physical stature.  Marfan syndrome: Introduction Aug 1, 2006. Symbolic log cabin at Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site.. For some time, Thomas Lincoln was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the Kentucky back country. He had purchased the Sinking Spring Farm in December of 1808 for $200 cash and assumption of a debt.  The farm site is now preserved as part of Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site.  The family belonged to a Baptist church that had seceded from a larger church over the issue of slavery. Though Lincoln was exposed to his parents' anti-slavery sentiment from a very young age, he never joined their church, or any other church for that matter.  As a youth he had little use for religion. Life of Abraham Lincoln, Colonel Ward H. Lamon, 1872 - portions reprinted in  Chapter VIII: Abraham Lincoln, Deist, and Admirer of Thomas Paine, From the book Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents by Franklin Steiner (1936). Lincoln was just seven years old when, in 1816, the family was forced to make a new start in Perry County (now in Spencer County), Indiana. He later noted that this move was \"partly on account of slavery,\" and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in Kentucky: Unlike land in the Northwest Territory, Kentucky never had a proper U.S. survey, and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property. Lincoln was only nine when his mother, then thirty-four years old, died of milk sickness. Soon afterwards, his father remarried  to Sarah Bush Johnston. Sarah Lincoln raised young Lincoln like one of her own children. Years later she compared Lincoln to her own son, saying \"Both were good boys, but I must say — both now being dead that Abe was the best boy I ever saw or ever expect to see.\" Lincoln was affectionate toward his stepmother, whom he would call \"Mother\" for the rest of his life, but he was distant from his father.  Donald, (1995) pp. 28, 152.. In 1830, after more economic and land-title difficulties in Indiana, the family settled on public land  /ref&gt; in Macon County, Illinois. Some scholars believe that it was his father's repeated land-title difficulties and ensuing financial hardships that led young Lincoln to study law.  The following winter was desolate and especially brutal, and the family considered moving back to Indiana. The following year, when his father relocated the family to a new homestead in Coles County, Illinois, twenty-two-year-old Lincoln struck out on his own, canoeing down the Sangamon River to the village of New Salem in Sangamon County. Later that year, hired by New Salem businessman Denton Offutt and accompanied by friends, he took goods from New Salem to New Orleans via flatboat on the Sangamon, Illinois and Mississippi rivers. While in New Orleans, he may have witnessed a slave auction, though as a frequent visitor to Kentucky, he would have had several earlier opportunities to witness  similar sales.  Donald, (1995) ch. 2.. Lincoln's formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling. Largely self-educated, he read every book he could get his hands on, once walking.  just to borrow one  While his favorite book was The Life of George Washington, Lincoln mastered the Bible, Shakespeare, and English and American history, and developed a plain writing style that puzzled audiences more used to grandiose rhetoric. He was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an ax; some rails he had allegedly split in his youth were exhibited at the 1860 Republican National Convention, as the party celebrated the poor-boy-made-good theme. Lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals, even for food. Though he was unusually tall at  , 4 inches and strong, Lincoln spent so much time reading that some neighbors suspected he must be doing it to avoid strenuous manual labor.. Young Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln began his political career in 1832, at age 23, with an unsuccessful campaign for the Illinois General Assembly, as a member of the Whig Party.  He ran eighth in a field of 13 candidates.  The centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the Sangamon River. He believed that this would attract steamboat traffic, which would allow the sparsely populated, poorer areas along the river to flourish.. He was elected captain of an Illinois militia company drawn from New Salem during the Black Hawk War, and later wrote that he had not had \"any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction.\"  Thomas (1952) 32-34; Basler (1946) p. 551   Though he never saw combat, Lincoln did assist in burying the dead from the Battle of Stillman's Run the day after Major Isaiah Stillman's troops fled the field of battle.  Abraham Lincoln Online Retrieved on March 11, 2007. For several months, Lincoln ran a small store in New Salem, selling tea, coffee, sugar, salt, blue calico, brown muslin, straw hats and whiskey.  Beveridge (1928) 1:127-8  Later, he found work as village postmaster and as a surveyor.. In 1834, he won election to the state legislature, and after coming across the Commentaries on the Laws of England, began to teach himself law. Admitted to the bar in 1837, he moved to Springfield, Illinois, that same year and began to practice law with John T. Stuart. With a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and in his closing arguments, Lincoln became one of the most respected and successful lawyers in Illinois and grew steadily more prosperous.. He served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a representative from Sangamon County, and became a leader of the Illinois Whig party. In 1837, he made his first protest against slavery in the Illinois House, stating that the institution was \"founded on both injustice and bad policy.\"  Protest in Illinois Legislature on Slavery, p.75, March 3, 1837  It was also in this same year that Lincoln met Joshua Fry Speed, who would become his most intimate friend.. Lincoln wrote a series of anonymous letters, published in 1842 in the Sangamon Journal, mocking State Auditor and prominent Democrat James Shields. Shields would later become a U.S. senator, but when he learned that it was Lincoln who had been writing the barbs, he challenged him to a duel. As Shields was the challenger, Lincoln was granted the right to choose the weapon and specified \"Cavalry broad swords of the largest size.\" Much taller and with long arms, this gave him an overwhelming advantage over his opponent; however, the duel was called off at the last minute. Beveridge (1928) 1:349. Lincoln had been practicing with the broad sword.  Two years later, Lincoln entered law practice with William Herndon, a fellow Whig. In 1854, both men joined the fledgling Republican Party. Following Lincoln's death, Herndon began collecting stories about Lincoln and published them in Herndon's Lincoln.. The first photograph ever taken of Mary Lincoln, a daguerreotype by Shepherd in 1846.. On November 4 1842 Lincoln married Mary Todd, daughter of a prominent slave-owning family from Kentucky. The couple had four sons. Robert Todd Lincoln was born in Springfield, Illinois on 1 August, 1843. Their only child to survive into adulthood, young Robert attended Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard College. Robert died on July 26, 1926, in Manchester, Vermont.. The other Lincoln children were born in Springfield, Illinois, and died either during childhood or their teen years. Edward Baker Lincoln was born on March 10, 1846, and died on 1 February, 1850, also in Springfield. William Wallace Lincoln was born on December 21, 1850, and died on February 20, 1862 in Washington, D.C., during Pres. Lincoln's first term. Thomas \"Tad\" Lincoln was born on 4 April, 1853, and died on July 16, 1871 in Chicago.. Four of his wife's brothers fought for the Confederacy, with one wounded and another killed in action. Lieutenant David H. Todd, a half-brother of Mary Todd Lincoln, served as commandant of the Libby Prison camp during the war.. The first photograph ever taken of Abraham Lincoln, a daguerreotype taken by Shepherd in 1846.. A Whig and an admirer of party leader Henry Clay,  Lincoln was elected to a term in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1846. As a freshman House member, he was not a particularly powerful or influential figure. He spoke out against the Mexican-American War, which he attributed to President Polk's desire for \"military glory — that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood.\" He also challenged the President's claims regarding the Texas boundary and offered Spot Resolutions demanding to know on what \"spot\" on US soil that blood was first spilt.  Congressional Globe, 30th Session (1848) pp.93-95  In January of 1848, he was among the 82 Whigs who defeated 81 Democrats in a procedural vote on an amendment to send a routine resolution back to committee with instructions to add the words \"a war unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the President of the United States.\" The amendment passed, but the bill never reemerged from committee and was never finally voted upon.  House Journal, 30th Session (1848) pp.183-184. Lincoln later damaged his political reputation with a speech in which he declared, \"God of Heaven has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent, and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men, women, and children, and lay waste and pillage the land of the just.\" Two weeks later, President Polk sent a peace treaty to Congress. While no one in Washington paid any attention to Lincoln, the Democrats orchestrated angry outbursts from across his district, where the war was popular and many had volunteered. In Morgan County, resolutions were adopted in fervent support of the war and in wrathful denunciation of the \"treasonable assaults of guerrillas at home; party demagogues; slanderers of the President; defenders of the butchery at the Alamo; traducers of the heroism at San Jacinto.\"  Abe Lincoln resource page. Warned by his law partner, William Herndon, that the damage was mounting and irreparable, Lincoln decided not to run for reelection. In fact, in 1848 he campaigned vigorously for Zachary Taylor, the successful general whose atrocities he had denounced in January. Regardless, his statements were not easily forgotten, and would haunt him during the Civil War. These statements were also held against him when he applied for a position in the new Taylor administration. Instead, Taylor's people offered Lincoln various positions in the remote Oregon Territory, primarily the governorship. Acceptance of this offer would have ended his career in the rapidly growing state of Illinois, so Lincoln declined the position. Returning to Springfield, Lincoln gave up politics for several years and turned his energies to his law practice. During this time, he made many trips on horseback between various counties' courthouses. Beveridge, (1928) 1: 428-33; Donald (1995) p. 140-43.. In the 1920s historical markers were placed at the county lines along the route Lincoln traveled in the eight judicial district. This example is on the border of Piatt and DeWitt counties. By the mid-1850s, Lincoln's caseload focused largely on the competing transportation interests of river barges and railroads. In one prominent 1851 case, he represented the Alton &amp; Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with a shareholder, James A. Barret. Barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to the railroad on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. Lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest, that the newer route proposed by Alton &amp; Sangamon was superior and less expensive, and that accordingly, the corporation had a right to sue Barret for his delinquent payment. He won this case, and the decision by the Illinois Supreme Court was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the United States. Donald, (1995) ch. 6.. Possibly the most notable criminal trial of Lincoln's career as a lawyer came in 1858, when he defended William \"Duff\" Armstrong, who has been charged with murder. The case became famous for Lincoln's use of judicial notice--a rare tactic at that time--to show that an eyewitness had lied on the stand. After the witness testified to having seen the crime by moonlight, Lincoln produced a Farmers' Almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle that it could not have provided enough illumination to see anything clearly. Based almost entirely on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted. Donald (1995), 150-51. Lincoln was involved in more than 5,100 cases in Illinois alone during his 23-year legal career. Though many of these cases involved little more than filing a writ, others were more substantial and quite involved. Lincoln and his partners appeared before the Illinois State Supreme Court more than 400 times. During one trial, Lincoln's voir dire included a question to prospective jurors as to whether they were acquainted with counsel for the other side. When a few of them turned out to know the other lawyer, the judge interrupted, saying, \"Mr. Lincoln, you are wasting the time of the court. The fact that a prospective juror knows your opponent does not disqualify him.\". \"No, Your Honor, I understand that,\" Lincoln answered. \"I'm afraid that some of them might not know him, which would place me at a disadvantage.\". Lincoln returned to politics in response to the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854), which expressly repealed the limits on slavery's extent as determined by the Missouri Compromise (1820). Illinois Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, the most powerful man in the Senate, proposed popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse, and incorporated it into the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory, rather than have such a decision imposed on them by Congress.  Donald, (1995) ch. 7.. In a speech against the act, on October 16 1854, delivered in Peoria, Lincoln first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day:. Drawing on remnants of the old Whig, Free Soil, Liberty and Democratic parties, he was instrumental in forming the new Republican Party. In a stirring campaign, the Republicans carried Illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. Lincoln was the obvious choice, but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an ex-Democrat Lyman Trumbull.. In 1857-58, Douglas broke with President Buchanan, leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state. Accepting the Republican nomination for Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered his famous speech: \"'A house divided against itself cannot stand.'(Mark 3:25) I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.\"  A House Divided Against Itself Cannot Stand, June 1858  The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the north.. The 1858 campaign featured the Lincoln-Douglas debates, a nationally famous contest on slavery. Lincoln warned that the \"Slave Power\" was threatening the values of republicanism, while Douglas emphasized the supremacy of democracy, as set forth in his Freeport Doctrine, which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not. Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature reelected Douglas to the Senate. Nevertheless, Lincoln's eloquence transformed him into a national political star.. During the debates of 1858, the issue of race was often discussed. During a time period when few believed in racial egalitarianism, Stephen Douglas informed the crowds, \"If you desire Negro citizenship… if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves… then support Mr. Lincoln and the Black Republican party, who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro.\"  First Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Ottawa, Illinois, August 21, 1858  Lincoln countered that he was \"not in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races.\"  Fourth Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Charleston, Illinois, September 18, 1858  His opposition to slavery was opposition to the Slave Power, though this would change during the course of the Civil War. Donald, (1995) ch. 8.. On May 9-10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur. At this convention, Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.. \"The Rail Candidate,\" Lincoln's 1860 candidacy is held up by slavery issue (slave on left) and party organization (New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley on right). Photo of Lincoln taken February 27, 1860 in New York City by Mathew Brady, the day of his famous Cooper Union speech.. Entering the presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog, Lincoln was eventually chosen as the Republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. His expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase. His \"Western\" origins also appealed to the newer states: other contenders, especially those with more governmental experience, had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states, while Lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the West. Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government. Yet despite his Southern connections (his in-laws owned slaves), Lincoln misunderstood the depth of the revolution underway in the South and the emergence of Southern nationalism. Throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war, and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession.  Gabor S. Boritt, \"'And the War Came'? Abraham Lincoln and the Question of Individual Responsibility,\" Why the Civil War Came ed by Boritt (1996), pp 3-30.. Throughout the election, Lincoln did not campaign or give speeches. This was handled by the state and county Republican organizations, who used the latest techniques to sustain party enthusiasm and thus obtain high turnout. There was little effort to convert non-Republicans, and there was virtually no campaigning in the South except for a few border cities such as St. Louis, Missouri, and Wheeling, Virginia; indeed, the party did not even run a slate in most of the South. In the North, there were thousands of Republican speakers, tons of campaign posters and leaflets, and thousands of newspaper editorials. These focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, making the most of his boyhood poverty, his pioneer background, his native genius, and his rise from obscurity. His nicknames, \"Honest Abe\" and \"the Rail-Splitter,\" were exploited to the full. The goal was to emphasize the superior power of \"free labor,\" whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts.  Thomas (1952) p 216; Reinhard H. Luthin, The First Lincoln Campaign (1944); Nevins vol 4;. On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, John C. Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and John Bell of the new Constitutional Union Party. He was the first Republican president, winning entirely on the strength of his support in the North: he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the South, and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other Southern states. Lincoln gained 1,865,908 votes (39.9% of the total), for 180 electoral votes; Douglas, 1,380,202 (29.5%) for 12 electoral votes; Breckenridge, 848,019 (18.1%) for 72 electoral votes; and Bell, 590,901 (12.5%) for 39 electoral votes. There were fusion tickets in some states, but even if his opponents had combined in every state, Lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election.. As Lincoln's election became more likely, secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the Union. South Carolina took the lead, followed by six other cotton-growing states in the deep South. The upper South (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to and rejected the secessionist appeal. They decided to stay in the Union, though they warned Lincoln that they would not support an invasion through their territory. The seven Confederate states seceded before Lincoln took office, declaring themselves to be a new nation, the Confederate States of America. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy.. President-elect Lincoln evaded possible assassins in Baltimore, and on February 23, 1861, arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C. At his inauguration on March 4, 1861, the German American Turners formed Lincoln's bodyguard; and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present, ready to protect the capital from Confederate invasion and local insurrection.. Photograph showing the March 4, 1861, inauguration of Abraham Lincoln in front of United States Capitol.. In his First Inaugural Address, Lincoln declared, \"I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments,\" arguing further that the purpose of the United States Constitution was \"to form a more perfect union\" than the Articles of Confederation which were explicitly perpetual, thus the Constitution too was perpetual. He asked rhetorically that even were the Constitution a simple contract, would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?. Also in his inaugural address, in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war, Lincoln supported the pending Corwin Amendment to the Constitution, which had already passed Congress. This amendment, which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it existed, was designed to appeal not to the Confederacy but to the critical border states. At the same time, Lincoln adamantly opposed the Crittenden Compromise, which would have permitted slavery in the territories. Despite support for the Crittenden compromise among some prominent Republicans (including William Seward), Lincoln denounced it saying that it \"would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people, tribe, and state owning a foot of land between here and Tierra del Fuego.\". By the time Lincoln took office, the Confederacy was an established fact, and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. No compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. Lincoln might have allowed the southern states to secede, and some Republicans recommended that. However, conservative Democratic nationalists, such as Jeremiah S. Black, Joseph Holt, and Edwin M. Stanton had taken control of Buchanan's cabinet around January 1, 1861, and refused to accept secession. Lincoln and nearly every Republican leader adopted this position by March 1861: the Union could not be dismantled. However, as a strict follower of the constitution, Lincoln refused to take any action against the South unless the Unionists themselves were attacked first. This finally happened in April 1861.. Historian Allan Nevins argues that Lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the Union, hold government property, and still avoid war. He \"temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis,\" overestimated the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South and border states, and misunderstood the conditional support of Unionists in the border states.  Allan Nevins, The Improvised War, 1861-1862 (1959) p 29. In April 1861, after Union troops at Fort Sumter were fired upon and forced to surrender, Lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and \"preserve the Union,\" which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. Virginia, which had repeatedly warned Lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state, responded by seceding, along with North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas.. The slave states of Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware did not secede, and Lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there, promising not to interfere with slavery. After the fighting started, he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas (especially in Maryland) and held in military prisons without trial. Over 18,000 were arrested, though none were executed. One, Clement Vallandigham, was exiled; but all of the remainder were released, usually after two or three months (see: Ex parte Merryman).. Lincoln met with his cabinet for the first reading of the Emancipation Proclamation draft on July 22, 1862. L-R: Edwin M. Stanton, Salmon P. Chase, Abraham Lincoln, Gideon Welles, Caleb B. Smith, William H. Seward, Montgomery Blair and Edward Bates. In July 1862, Congress moved to free the slaves by passing the Second Confiscation Act. The goal was to weaken the rebellion, which was led and controlled by slave owners. While it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery (the Thirteenth Amendment did that), the Act showed that Lincoln had the support of Congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. This new law was implemented with Lincoln's \"Emancipation Proclamation.\". Lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the United States. In 1861 – 1862, however, he made it clear that the North was fighting the war to preserve the Union, not to abolish slavery. Freeing the slaves became, in late 1862, a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. Abolitionists criticized Lincoln for his sluggishness over slavery per se, but on August 22, 1862, Lincoln explained:. The Emancipation Proclamation, announced on September 22 and put into effect on January 1, 1863, freed slaves in territories not under Union control. As Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all of them in Confederate hands (over three million) were freed. Lincoln later said: \"I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.\" The proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. Lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation. Lincoln addressed the issue of his consistency in an 1864 letter to Albert G. Hodges.  Letter to Albert G. Hodges, April 4, 1864. In September 1862, thirteen northern governors met in Altoona, Pennsylvania, at the Loyal War Governors' Conference to discuss the Proclamation and Union war effort. In the end, the state executives fully supported the president's Proclamation and also suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union's Army of the Potomac.  Images of America: Altoona, by Sr. Anne Francis Pulling, 2001, 10.. For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. As Frederick Douglass observed, Lincoln was, \"The first great man that I talked with in the United States freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself, of the difference of color.\" Life and Times of Frederick Douglass, by Frederick Douglass, 1895. After Union victories at Gettysburg, Vicksburg and Chattanooga in 1863, victory seemed at hand, and Lincoln promoted Ulysses S. Grant General-in-Chief ( March 12, 1864). When the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates, Lincoln supported Grant's strategy of wearing down Lee's Confederate army at the cost of heavy Union casualties. With an election looming, he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. At the Convention, the Republican Party selected Andrew Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. They ran on the new Union Party ticket uniting Republicans and War Democrats.. Lincoln, in top hat, with Allan Pinkerton and Gen. John Alexander McClernand at Antietam.. Nevertheless, Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Acknowledging this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would nonetheless defeat the Confederacy by an all-out military effort before turning over the White House: Mark Grimsley and Brooks D Simpson, eds. The Collapse of the Confederacy (2001) p 80. Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.. While the Democratic platform followed the Peace wing of the party and called the war a \"failure,\" their candidate, General George B. McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform.. Lincoln provided Grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to support Grant and win local support for the war effort. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September ended defeatist jitters; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln; the Union party was united and energized, and Lincoln was easily reelected in a landslide. He won all but two states, capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.. On March 4 1865, Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address, his favorite of all his speeches. At this time, a victory over the rebels was at hand, slavery was dead, and Lincoln was looking to the future.. “Running the ‘Machine’”. An 1864 cartoon featuring Lincoln, William Fessenden, Edwin Stanton, William Seward and Gideon Welles takes a swing at the Lincoln administration. The war was a source of constant frustration for the president, and occupied nearly all of his time. He had a contentious relationship with General McClellan, who became general-in-chief of all the Union armies in the wake of the embarrassing Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run and after the retirement of Winfield Scott in late 1861. Despite his inexperience in military affairs, Lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. His priorities were twofold: to ensure that Washington, D.C., was well defended; and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the Northern public and press. McClellan, a youthful West Point graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service, took a more cautious approach. He took several months to plan and execute his Peninsula Campaign, with the objective of capturing Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula between the James and York Rivers. McClellan's delay irritated Lincoln, as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend Washington, D.C. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops to defend the capital, a decision McClellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.. McClellan, a lifelong Democrat who was temperamentally conservative, was relieved as general-in-chief after releasing his Harrison's Landing Letter, where he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint John Pope, a Republican, as head of the new Army of Virginia. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack. But Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. In response to his failure, Pope was sent to Minnesota to fight the Sioux.. An 1864 Mathew Brady photo depicts President Lincoln reading a book with his youngest son, Tad. Panicked by Lee's invasion of Maryland, Lincoln restored McClellan to command of all forces around Washington in time for the Battle of Antietam (September 1862). The ensuing Union victory enabled Lincoln to release his Emancipation Proclamation, but he relieved McClellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed Republican Ambrose Burnside to head the Army of the Potomac. Burnside had promised to follow through on Lincoln's strategic vision for a strong offensive against Lee and Richmond. After Burnside was stunningly defeated at Fredericksburg, Joseph Hooker was given the command, despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders.  Joseph Hooker biography  Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville (May 1863), and relieved of command early in the subsequent Gettysburg Campaign replaced by George Meade.. After the Union victory at Gettysburg, Meade's failure to pursue Lee and months of inactivity for the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to bring in a western general, Ulysses S. Grant. Grant already had a solid string of victories in the Western Theater, including the battles of Vicksburg and Chattanooga. Responding to criticism of Grant, Lincoln was quoted as saying, \"I cannot spare this man. He fights.\" Grant waged his bloody Overland Campaign in 1864 with a strategy of a war of attrition, characterized by high Union losses at battles such as the Wilderness and Cold Harbor, but by proportionately higher Confederate losses. His invasion campaign eventually bottled Lee up in the Siege of Petersburg, so that Grant could take Richmond, and bring the war to a close in the spring of 1865.. Lincoln authorized Grant to target civilians and infrastructure, hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. This allowed Generals Sherman and Sheridan to destroy farms and towns in the Shenandoah Valley, Georgia, and South Carolina. The damage caused by Sherman's March to the Sea through Georgia totaled in excess of $100 million by Sherman's own estimate. See Hofstadter, Richard, The United States: The History of a Republic, Prentice-Hall, 1967, p. 446.. Lincoln had a star-crossed record as a military leader, possessing a keen understanding of strategic points (such as the Mississippi River and the fortress city of Vicksburg) and the importance of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing cities. He had, however, limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863, when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in Ulysses S. Grant. Only then could he insist on using African American troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.. Throughout the war, Lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. He spent hours at the War Department telegraph office, reading dispatches from his generals. He visited battle sites frequently, and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. During Jubal Anderson Early's raid on Washington, D.C. in 1864, Lincoln had to be told to duck to avoid being shot while observing the battle.. Reconstruction began during the war as Lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the Southern states and what to do with Confederate leaders and the freed slaves. Lincoln led the \"moderates\" regarding Reconstructionist policy, and was usually opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Thaddeus Stevens in the House and Charles Sumner and Benjamin Wade in the Senate (though he cooperated with these men on most other issues). Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind Union lines. His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.  /ref&gt; Critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. Of special importance were Tennessee, where Lincoln appointed Andrew Johnson as governor, and Louisiana, where Lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. The Radicals thought this policy too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864. When Lincoln pocket-vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.  Donald (1995) ch. 20. On April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House in Virginia, and the war was effectively over. The other rebel armies surrendered soon after, and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare. Lincoln went to Richmond to make a public gesture of sitting at Jefferson Davis's own desk, symbolically saying to the nation that the President of the United States held authority over the entire land. He was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves, whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer's quote, \"I know I am free for I have seen the face of Father Abraham and have felt him.\" When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, Lincoln replied, \"Let 'em up easy.\"  Donald (1995) 576, 580,   \"President Lincoln Enters Richmond, 1865\" EyeWitness to History, www.eywitnesstohistory.com (2000).. One of the last photographs of Lincoln, likely taken between February and April 1865. Lincoln's powerful rhetoric defined the issues of the war for the nation, the world, and posterity. His extraordinary command of the English language was evidenced in the Gettysburg Address, a speech dedicating the cemetery at Gettysburg that he delivered on November 19, 1863. The speech defied Lincoln's own prediction that \"the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here.\" Lincoln's second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted. In these speeches, Lincoln articulated better than anyone else the rationale behind the Union cause.. In recent years, historians have stressed Lincoln's use of and redefinition of republican values. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln shifted emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism.  Jaffa (2000) p. 399  The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, rather than the Constitution's tolerance of slavers, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.\"  John Patrick Diggins, The Lost Soul of American Politics: Virtue, Self-interest, and the Foundations of Liberalism (1986) p. 307.  His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.  Foner (1970) p. 215 says, \"Lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism.\"  See also McPherson (1992) pp.61-64.  Nevertheless, in 1861 Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a \"republican form of government\" in every state. Jaffa (2000) p. 263  That duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in Reconstruction.. Lincoln's second inauguration on March 4, 1865. In the photo, Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth, can be seen in the crowd at the top and accomplices David Herold, Lewis Powell, George Atzerodt, John Surratt and Edmund Spangler in the bottom crowd. In his Gettysburg Address Lincoln redefined the American nation, arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776, \"conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\" He declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality, \"that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\" By emphasizing the centrality of the nation, he rebuffed the claims of state sovereignty. While some critics say Lincoln moved too far and too fast,  H.L. Mencken said \"It is difficult to imagine anything more untrue. The Union soldiers in the battle actually fought against self-determination; it was the Confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves.\" Mencken did not mention the right of self-determination rights for blacks.   they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked \"a new founding of the nation.\"  Wills (1992) p. 39.. During the Civil War, Lincoln appropriated powers no previous President had wielded: he used his war powers to proclaim a blockade, suspended the writ of habeas corpus, spent money without congressional authorization, and imprisoned 18,000 suspected Confederate sympathizers without trial. Nearly all of his actions, although vehemently denounced by the Copperheads, were subsequently upheld by Congress and the Courts.. Lincoln believed in the Whig theory of the presidency, which left Congress to write the laws while he signed them, vetoing only those bills that threatened his war powers. Thus, he signed the Homestead Act in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in 1869. Other important legislation involved economic matters, including the first income tax and higher tariffs. Also included was the creation of the system of national banks by the National Banking Acts of 1863, 1864, and 1865, which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system.  Congress created and Lincoln approved the Department of Agriculture in 1862, although that institution would not become a Cabinet-level department until 1889.. The Legal Tender Act of 1862 established the United States Note, the first paper currency in United States history.  This was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.. During the war, Lincoln's Treasury Department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied South—the most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.. In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope, to put down the \"Sioux Uprising\" in Minnesota. Presented with 303 death warrants for convicted Santee Dakota who had massacred innocent farmers, Lincoln affirmed 39 of these for execution (one was later reprieved).. The assassination of Abraham Lincoln. From left to right: Henry Rathbone, Clara Harris, Mary Todd Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth. Originally, John Wilkes Booth, a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland, had formulated a plan to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and determined to assassinate the president. Harrison, Lowell Hayes, Lincoln of Kentucky, University Press of Kentucky, 2000, pp. 3–4. ISBN 0813121566.  Learning that the President and First Lady, together with the Grants, would be attending Ford's Theatre, he laid his plans, assigning his co-conspirators to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward.. Without his main bodyguard Ward Hill Lamon, to whom he related his famous dream regarding his own assassination, Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14, 1865. As a lone bodyguard wandered, and Lincoln sat in his state box (Box 7) in the balcony, Booth crept up behind the President and waited for the funniest line of the play, hoping the laughter would muffle the noise of the gunshot. When the laughter began, Booth jumped into the box and aimed a single-shot, round-slug .44 caliber Henry Deringer at his head, firing at point-blank range. Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth but was cut by Booth's knife. Booth then leapt to the stage and shouted \"Sic semper tyrannis!\" (Latin: \"Thus always to tyrants\") and escaped, despite a broken leg suffered in the leap. George Alfred Townsend, The Life, Crime and Capture of John Wilkes Booth. New York: Dick &amp; Fitzgerald, 1865. (LCCN  12002580.  A twelve-day manhunt ensued, in which Booth was chased by Federal agents (under the direction of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton). He was eventually cornered in a Virginia barn house  and shot, dying of his wounds soon after.. An army surgeon, Doctor Charles Leale, initially assessed Lincoln's wound as mortal. The President was taken across the street from the theater to the Petersen House, where he lay in a coma for nine hours before he died. Several physicians attended Lincoln, including U.S. Army Surgeon General Joseph K. Barnes of the Army Medical Museum. Using a probe, Barnes located some fragments of Lincoln's skull and the ball lodged 6 inches (15 cm) inside his brain. Lincoln never regained consciousness and was officially pronounced dead at 7:22:10 a.m. April 15, 1865 at the age of 56. There is some disagreement among historians as to Stanton's words after Lincoln died. All agree that he began \"Now he belongs to the...\" with some stating he said \"ages\" while others believe he said \"angels.\"  After Lincoln's body was returned to the White House, his body was prepared for his lying in repose in the East Room. He was the first president to lie in state.. The Army Medical Museum, now named the National Museum of Health and Medicine, has retained in its collection several artifacts relating to the assassination. Currently on display are the bullet that was fired from the Derringer pistol, the probe used by Barnes, pieces of Lincoln's skull and hair, and the surgeon's cuff stained with Lincoln's blood.. Lincoln's funeral train carried his remains, as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son William, 1,654 miles (2,661 km) to Illinois . Lincoln's body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to Illinois.  While much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the United States, Copperheads celebrated the death of a man they considered an unconstitutional tyrant. The Lincoln Tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, is 177 feet (54 m) tall and, by 1874, was surmounted with several bronze statues of Lincoln. To prevent repeated attempts to steal Lincoln's body and hold it for ransom, Robert Todd Lincoln had Lincoln exhumed and reinterred in concrete several feet thick in 1901.. With over 120 photographs taken of him, Lincoln was the most photographed man in the United States up to the time he was assassinated.. Lincoln was known for appointing political rivals to high positions in his cabinet to keep in line all factions of his party — and to let them battle each other and not combine against Lincoln. Historians agree that except for Simon Cameron, it was a highly effective group.. Abraham Lincoln's official White House portrait. Lincoln appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States:. In March 1860 in a speech in New Haven, Connecticut, Lincoln said, with respect to slavery, “Whenever this question shall be settled, it must be settled on some philosophical basis. No policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained.\" The philosophical basis for Lincoln’s beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that Lincoln be examined \"seriously as a man of ideas.\" Lincoln was a strong supporter of the American Whig version of liberal capitalism who, more than most politicians of the time, was able to express his ideas within the context of Nineteenth Century religious beliefs. Guelzo pg. 18-19. There were few people who strongly or directly influenced Lincoln’s moral and intellectual development and perspectives. There was no teacher, mentor, church leader, community leader, or peer that Lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. Lacking a formal education, Lincoln’s personal philosophy was shaped by \"an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning.\" It was Lincoln’s reading, rather than his relationships, that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs. Guelzo pg. 20. Miller pg. 57-59  Lincoln’s reading and study of the Bible was an integral part of his intellectual roots.. Lincoln did, even as a boy, largely reject organized religion, but the Calvinistic \"doctrine of necessity\" would remain a factor throughout his life. In 1846 Lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as \"that the human mind is impelled to action, or held in rest by some power, over which the mind itself has no control.\" Donald pg. 15. The quote came from a letter to the public in which Lincoln was denying charges by a political opponent that he was a “religious scoffer.”  In April 1864, in justifying his actions in regard to Emancipation, Lincoln wrote, \"I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of three years struggle the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. God alone can claim it.\" Donald pg. 514. As Lincoln matured, and especially during his term as president, the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. On a personal level, the death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace. Wilson pg. 251-254  After Willie’s death, in the summer or early fall of 1862, Lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary:. Lincoln’s religious skepticism was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the Lockean Enlightenment and classical liberalism, especially economic liberalism. Guelzo pg. 20  Consistent with the common practice of the Whig party, Lincoln would often use the Declaration of Independence as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies. Guelzo pg.194  In a February 22, 1861 speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia Lincoln said,. He found in the Declaration justification for Whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the nativist platform of the Know Nothings. In claiming that all men were created free, Lincoln and the Whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement, expanded education, territory to grow, and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population. Guelzo pg.194-195. It was the Declaration of Independence, rather than the Bible, that Lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. He saw the Declaration as more than a political document. To him, as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders, it was, foremost, a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation. Miller pg. 297. While Lincoln is usually portrayed bearded, he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year-old Grace Bedell. Lincoln's death made the President a martyr to many. Repeated polls of historians have ranked Lincoln as among the greatest presidents in U.S. history, often appearing in the first position. Among contemporary admirers, Lincoln is usually seen as personifying classical values of honesty and integrity, as well as respect for individual and minority rights, and human freedom in general.. Many American organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image, with interests ranging from the gay rights-supporting Log Cabin Republicans to the insurance corporation Lincoln National Corporation. The Lincoln automobile is also named after him. The ballistic missile submarine Abraham Lincoln (SSBN-602) and the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) were named in his honor. Also, the Liberty ship, SS Nancy Hanks was named to honor his mother. During the Spanish Civil War the American faction of the International Brigades named themselves the Abraham Lincoln Brigade after Lincoln.. Lincoln has been memorialized in many city names, notably the capital of Nebraska. Lincoln, Illinois, is the only city to be named for Abraham Lincoln before he became President. Lincoln's name and image appear in numerous places. These include the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., the U.S. Lincoln $5 bill and the Lincoln cent, Lincoln's sculpture on the Mount Rushmore, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois. In addition, New Salem, Illinois (a reconstruction of Lincoln's early adult hometown), Ford's Theatre, and Petersen House (where he died) are all preserved as museums. The Lincoln Shrine in Redlands, California, is located behind the A.K. Smiley Public Library. The state nickname for Illinois is Land of Lincoln.. Counties in 19 U.S. states (Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) are named after Lincoln.. Abraham Lincoln's birthday, February 12, was formerly a national holiday, now commemorated as Presidents' Day. However, it is still observed in Illinois and many other states as a separate legal holiday, Lincoln's Birthday. A dozen states have legal holidays celebrating the third Monday in February as 'Presidents' Day' as a combination Washington-Lincoln Day.. To commemorate his upcoming 200th birthday in February 2009, Congress established the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission (ALBC) in 2000. Dedicated to renewing American appreciation of Lincoln’s legacy, the 15-member commission is made up of lawmakers and scholars and also features an adivsory board of over 130 various Lincoln historians and enthusiasts. Located at Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., the ALBC is the organizing force behind numerous tributes, programs and cultural events highlighting a two-year celebration scheduled to begin in February 2008 at Lincoln’s birthplace:  Hodgenville, Kentucky.. Lincoln's birthplace and family home are national historic memorials: the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site in Hodgenville, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois. The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum opened in Springfield in 2005; it is a major tourist attraction, with state-of-the-art exhibits.

As an outspoken opponent of the expansion of slavery in the United States, \"[I]n his short autobiography written for the 1860 presidential campaign, Lincoln would describe his protest in the Illinois legislature as one that 'briefly defined his position on the slavery question, and so far as it goes, it was then the same that it is now.\" This was in reference to the anti-expansion sentiments he had then expressed. Doris Kearns Goodwin, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln (2005) p. 91.  Holzer pg. 232.  Writing of the Cooper Union  speech, Holzer notes, \"Cooper Union proved a unique confluence of political culture, rhetorical opportunity, technological innovation, and human genius, and it brought Abraham Lincoln to the center stage of American politics at precisely the right time and place, and with precisely the right message: that slavery was wrong, and ought to be confined to the areas where it already existed, and placed on the 'course of ultimate extinction... .'\"  Lincoln won the Republican Party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year. During his term, he helped preserve the United States by leading the defeat of the secessionist Confederate States of America in the American Civil War. He introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery, issuing his Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1865.. Lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including Ulysses S. Grant. Historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the Republican Party well, bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. Lincoln successfully defused a war scare with the United Kingdom in 1861. Under his leadership, the Union took control of the border slave states at the start of the war. Additionally, he managed his own reelection in the 1864 presidential election.. Opponents of the war (also known as \"Copperheads\") criticized him for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans, an abolitionist faction of the Republican Party, criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. Even with these problems, Lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches; his Gettysburg Address is but one example of this. At the close of the war, Lincoln held a moderate view of Reconstruction, seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. His assassination in 1865 was the first presidential assassination in U.S. history and made him a martyr for the ideal of national unity.. Scholars now rank Lincoln among the top three U.S. Presidents, with the majority of those surveyed placing him first. He is noted for his lasting influence on U.S. politics, including a redefinition of republicanism.  As Diggins explains, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.\" John Patrick Diggins, The Lost Soul of American Politics: Virtue, Self-interest, and the Foundations of Liberalism (1986) p. 307. Foner (1970) p. 215 noted that, \"Lincoln stressed the moral basis of Republicanism.\" Jaffa (2000) p. 399, stresses Lincoln's emphasis on the Declaration of Independence as what Lincoln called the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism. See also McPherson (1992) pp.61-64.. Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, to Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks, two uneducated farmers. Lincoln was born in a one-room log cabin on the   Sinking Spring Farm, in southeast Hardin County, Kentucky (now part of LaRue County). This area was at the time considered the \"frontier.\" The name \"Abraham\" was chosen to commemorate his grandfather, who was killed in an American Indian raid in 1786. Donald (1995) p 21  His elder sister, Sarah Lincoln, was born in 1807; a younger brother, Thomas Jr, died in infancy. It is sometimes debated whether Lincoln had Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of the connective tissue characterized by long limbs and great physical stature.  Marfan syndrome: Introduction Aug 1, 2006. Symbolic log cabin at Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site.. For some time, Thomas Lincoln was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the Kentucky back country. He had purchased the Sinking Spring Farm in December of 1808 for $200 cash and assumption of a debt.  The farm site is now preserved as part of Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site.  The family belonged to a Baptist church that had seceded from a larger church over the issue of slavery. Though Lincoln was exposed to his parents' anti-slavery sentiment from a very young age, he never joined their church, or any other church for that matter.  As a youth he had little use for religion. Life of Abraham Lincoln, Colonel Ward H. Lamon, 1872 - portions reprinted in  Chapter VIII: Abraham Lincoln, Deist, and Admirer of Thomas Paine, From the book Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents by Franklin Steiner (1936). Lincoln was just seven years old when, in 1816, the family was forced to make a new start in Perry County (now in Spencer County), Indiana. He later noted that this move was \"partly on account of slavery,\" and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in Kentucky: Unlike land in the Northwest Territory, Kentucky never had a proper U.S. survey, and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property. Lincoln was only nine when his mother, then thirty-four years old, died of milk sickness. Soon afterwards, his father remarried  to Sarah Bush Johnston. Sarah Lincoln raised young Lincoln like one of her own children. Years later she compared Lincoln to her own son, saying \"Both were good boys, but I must say — both now being dead that Abe was the best boy I ever saw or ever expect to see.\" Lincoln was affectionate toward his stepmother, whom he would call \"Mother\" for the rest of his life, but he was distant from his father.  Donald, (1995) pp. 28, 152.. In 1830, after more economic and land-title difficulties in Indiana, the family settled on public land  /ref&gt; in Macon County, Illinois. Some scholars believe that it was his father's repeated land-title difficulties and ensuing financial hardships that led young Lincoln to study law.  The following winter was desolate and especially brutal, and the family considered moving back to Indiana. The following year, when his father relocated the family to a new homestead in Coles County, Illinois, twenty-two-year-old Lincoln struck out on his own, canoeing down the Sangamon River to the village of New Salem in Sangamon County. Later that year, hired by New Salem businessman Denton Offutt and accompanied by friends, he took goods from New Salem to New Orleans via flatboat on the Sangamon, Illinois and Mississippi rivers. While in New Orleans, he may have witnessed a slave auction, though as a frequent visitor to Kentucky, he would have had several earlier opportunities to witness  similar sales.  Donald, (1995) ch. 2.. Lincoln's formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling. Largely self-educated, he read every book he could get his hands on, once walking.  just to borrow one  While his favorite book was The Life of George Washington, Lincoln mastered the Bible, Shakespeare, and English and American history, and developed a plain writing style that puzzled audiences more used to grandiose rhetoric. He was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an ax; some rails he had allegedly split in his youth were exhibited at the 1860 Republican National Convention, as the party celebrated the poor-boy-made-good theme. Lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals, even for food. Though he was unusually tall at  , 4 inches and strong, Lincoln spent so much time reading that some neighbors suspected he must be doing it to avoid strenuous manual labor.. Young Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln began his political career in 1832, at age 23, with an unsuccessful campaign for the Illinois General Assembly, as a member of the Whig Party.  He ran eighth in a field of 13 candidates.  The centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the Sangamon River. He believed that this would attract steamboat traffic, which would allow the sparsely populated, poorer areas along the river to flourish.. He was elected captain of an Illinois militia company drawn from New Salem during the Black Hawk War, and later wrote that he had not had \"any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction.\"  Thomas (1952) 32-34; Basler (1946) p. 551   Though he never saw combat, Lincoln did assist in burying the dead from the Battle of Stillman's Run the day after Major Isaiah Stillman's troops fled the field of battle.  Abraham Lincoln Online Retrieved on March 11, 2007. For several months, Lincoln ran a small store in New Salem, selling tea, coffee, sugar, salt, blue calico, brown muslin, straw hats and whiskey.  Beveridge (1928) 1:127-8  Later, he found work as village postmaster and as a surveyor.. In 1834, he won election to the state legislature, and after coming across the Commentaries on the Laws of England, began to teach himself law. Admitted to the bar in 1837, he moved to Springfield, Illinois, that same year and began to practice law with John T. Stuart. With a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and in his closing arguments, Lincoln became one of the most respected and successful lawyers in Illinois and grew steadily more prosperous.. He served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a representative from Sangamon County, and became a leader of the Illinois Whig party. In 1837, he made his first protest against slavery in the Illinois House, stating that the institution was \"founded on both injustice and bad policy.\"  Protest in Illinois Legislature on Slavery, p.75, March 3, 1837  It was also in this same year that Lincoln met Joshua Fry Speed, who would become his most intimate friend.. Lincoln wrote a series of anonymous letters, published in 1842 in the Sangamon Journal, mocking State Auditor and prominent Democrat James Shields. Shields would later become a U.S. senator, but when he learned that it was Lincoln who had been writing the barbs, he challenged him to a duel. As Shields was the challenger, Lincoln was granted the right to choose the weapon and specified \"Cavalry broad swords of the largest size.\" Much taller and with long arms, this gave him an overwhelming advantage over his opponent; however, the duel was called off at the last minute. Beveridge (1928) 1:349. Lincoln had been practicing with the broad sword.  Two years later, Lincoln entered law practice with William Herndon, a fellow Whig. In 1854, both men joined the fledgling Republican Party. Following Lincoln's death, Herndon began collecting stories about Lincoln and published them in Herndon's Lincoln.. The first photograph ever taken of Mary Lincoln, a daguerreotype by Shepherd in 1846.. On November 4 1842 Lincoln married Mary Todd, daughter of a prominent slave-owning family from Kentucky. The couple had four sons. Robert Todd Lincoln was born in Springfield, Illinois on 1 August, 1843. Their only child to survive into adulthood, young Robert attended Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard College. Robert died on July 26, 1926, in Manchester, Vermont.. The other Lincoln children were born in Springfield, Illinois, and died either during childhood or their teen years. Edward Baker Lincoln was born on March 10, 1846, and died on 1 February, 1850, also in Springfield. William Wallace Lincoln was born on December 21, 1850, and died on February 20, 1862 in Washington, D.C., during Pres. Lincoln's first term. Thomas \"Tad\" Lincoln was born on 4 April, 1853, and died on July 16, 1871 in Chicago.. Four of his wife's brothers fought for the Confederacy, with one wounded and another killed in action. Lieutenant David H. Todd, a half-brother of Mary Todd Lincoln, served as commandant of the Libby Prison camp during the war.. The first photograph ever taken of Abraham Lincoln, a daguerreotype taken by Shepherd in 1846.. A Whig and an admirer of party leader Henry Clay,  Lincoln was elected to a term in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1846. As a freshman House member, he was not a particularly powerful or influential figure. He spoke out against the Mexican-American War, which he attributed to President Polk's desire for \"military glory — that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood.\" He also challenged the President's claims regarding the Texas boundary and offered Spot Resolutions demanding to know on what \"spot\" on US soil that blood was first spilt.  Congressional Globe, 30th Session (1848) pp.93-95  In January of 1848, he was among the 82 Whigs who defeated 81 Democrats in a procedural vote on an amendment to send a routine resolution back to committee with instructions to add the words \"a war unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the President of the United States.\" The amendment passed, but the bill never reemerged from committee and was never finally voted upon.  House Journal, 30th Session (1848) pp.183-184. Lincoln later damaged his political reputation with a speech in which he declared, \"God of Heaven has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent, and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men, women, and children, and lay waste and pillage the land of the just.\" Two weeks later, President Polk sent a peace treaty to Congress. While no one in Washington paid any attention to Lincoln, the Democrats orchestrated angry outbursts from across his district, where the war was popular and many had volunteered. In Morgan County, resolutions were adopted in fervent support of the war and in wrathful denunciation of the \"treasonable assaults of guerrillas at home; party demagogues; slanderers of the President; defenders of the butchery at the Alamo; traducers of the heroism at San Jacinto.\"  Abe Lincoln resource page. Warned by his law partner, William Herndon, that the damage was mounting and irreparable, Lincoln decided not to run for reelection. In fact, in 1848 he campaigned vigorously for Zachary Taylor, the successful general whose atrocities he had denounced in January. Regardless, his statements were not easily forgotten, and would haunt him during the Civil War. These statements were also held against him when he applied for a position in the new Taylor administration. Instead, Taylor's people offered Lincoln various positions in the remote Oregon Territory, primarily the governorship. Acceptance of this offer would have ended his career in the rapidly growing state of Illinois, so Lincoln declined the position. Returning to Springfield, Lincoln gave up politics for several years and turned his energies to his law practice. During this time, he made many trips on horseback between various counties' courthouses. Beveridge, (1928) 1: 428-33; Donald (1995) p. 140-43.. In the 1920s historical markers were placed at the county lines along the route Lincoln traveled in the eight judicial district. This example is on the border of Piatt and DeWitt counties. By the mid-1850s, Lincoln's caseload focused largely on the competing transportation interests of river barges and railroads. In one prominent 1851 case, he represented the Alton &amp; Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with a shareholder, James A. Barret. Barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to the railroad on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. Lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest, that the newer route proposed by Alton &amp; Sangamon was superior and less expensive, and that accordingly, the corporation had a right to sue Barret for his delinquent payment. He won this case, and the decision by the Illinois Supreme Court was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the United States. Donald, (1995) ch. 6.. Possibly the most notable criminal trial of Lincoln's career as a lawyer came in 1858, when he defended William \"Duff\" Armstrong, who has been charged with murder. The case became famous for Lincoln's use of judicial notice--a rare tactic at that time--to show that an eyewitness had lied on the stand. After the witness testified to having seen the crime by moonlight, Lincoln produced a Farmers' Almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle that it could not have provided enough illumination to see anything clearly. Based almost entirely on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted. Donald (1995), 150-51. Lincoln was involved in more than 5,100 cases in Illinois alone during his 23-year legal career. Though many of these cases involved little more than filing a writ, others were more substantial and quite involved. Lincoln and his partners appeared before the Illinois State Supreme Court more than 400 times. During one trial, Lincoln's voir dire included a question to prospective jurors as to whether they were acquainted with counsel for the other side. When a few of them turned out to know the other lawyer, the judge interrupted, saying, \"Mr. Lincoln, you are wasting the time of the court. The fact that a prospective juror knows your opponent does not disqualify him.\". \"No, Your Honor, I understand that,\" Lincoln answered. \"I'm afraid that some of them might not know him, which would place me at a disadvantage.\". Lincoln returned to politics in response to the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854), which expressly repealed the limits on slavery's extent as determined by the Missouri Compromise (1820). Illinois Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, the most powerful man in the Senate, proposed popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse, and incorporated it into the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory, rather than have such a decision imposed on them by Congress.  Donald, (1995) ch. 7.. In a speech against the act, on October 16 1854, delivered in Peoria, Lincoln first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day:. Drawing on remnants of the old Whig, Free Soil, Liberty and Democratic parties, he was instrumental in forming the new Republican Party. In a stirring campaign, the Republicans carried Illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. Lincoln was the obvious choice, but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an ex-Democrat Lyman Trumbull.. In 1857-58, Douglas broke with President Buchanan, leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state. Accepting the Republican nomination for Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered his famous speech: \"'A house divided against itself cannot stand.'(Mark 3:25) I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.\"  A House Divided Against Itself Cannot Stand, June 1858  The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the north.. The 1858 campaign featured the Lincoln-Douglas debates, a nationally famous contest on slavery. Lincoln warned that the \"Slave Power\" was threatening the values of republicanism, while Douglas emphasized the supremacy of democracy, as set forth in his Freeport Doctrine, which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not. Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature reelected Douglas to the Senate. Nevertheless, Lincoln's eloquence transformed him into a national political star.. During the debates of 1858, the issue of race was often discussed. During a time period when few believed in racial egalitarianism, Stephen Douglas informed the crowds, \"If you desire Negro citizenship… if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves… then support Mr. Lincoln and the Black Republican party, who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro.\"  First Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Ottawa, Illinois, August 21, 1858  Lincoln countered that he was \"not in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races.\"  Fourth Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Charleston, Illinois, September 18, 1858  His opposition to slavery was opposition to the Slave Power, though this would change during the course of the Civil War. Donald, (1995) ch. 8.. On May 9-10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur. At this convention, Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.. \"The Rail Candidate,\" Lincoln's 1860 candidacy is held up by slavery issue (slave on left) and party organization (New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley on right). Photo of Lincoln taken February 27, 1860 in New York City by Mathew Brady, the day of his famous Cooper Union speech.. Entering the presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog, Lincoln was eventually chosen as the Republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. His expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase. His \"Western\" origins also appealed to the newer states: other contenders, especially those with more governmental experience, had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states, while Lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the West. Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government. Yet despite his Southern connections (his in-laws owned slaves), Lincoln misunderstood the depth of the revolution underway in the South and the emergence of Southern nationalism. Throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war, and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession.  Gabor S. Boritt, \"'And the War Came'? Abraham Lincoln and the Question of Individual Responsibility,\" Why the Civil War Came ed by Boritt (1996), pp 3-30.. Throughout the election, Lincoln did not campaign or give speeches. This was handled by the state and county Republican organizations, who used the latest techniques to sustain party enthusiasm and thus obtain high turnout. There was little effort to convert non-Republicans, and there was virtually no campaigning in the South except for a few border cities such as St. Louis, Missouri, and Wheeling, Virginia; indeed, the party did not even run a slate in most of the South. In the North, there were thousands of Republican speakers, tons of campaign posters and leaflets, and thousands of newspaper editorials. These focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, making the most of his boyhood poverty, his pioneer background, his native genius, and his rise from obscurity. His nicknames, \"Honest Abe\" and \"the Rail-Splitter,\" were exploited to the full. The goal was to emphasize the superior power of \"free labor,\" whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts.  Thomas (1952) p 216; Reinhard H. Luthin, The First Lincoln Campaign (1944); Nevins vol 4;. On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, John C. Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and John Bell of the new Constitutional Union Party. He was the first Republican president, winning entirely on the strength of his support in the North: he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the South, and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other Southern states. Lincoln gained 1,865,908 votes (39.9% of the total), for 180 electoral votes; Douglas, 1,380,202 (29.5%) for 12 electoral votes; Breckenridge, 848,019 (18.1%) for 72 electoral votes; and Bell, 590,901 (12.5%) for 39 electoral votes. There were fusion tickets in some states, but even if his opponents had combined in every state, Lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election.. As Lincoln's election became more likely, secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the Union. South Carolina took the lead, followed by six other cotton-growing states in the deep South. The upper South (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to and rejected the secessionist appeal. They decided to stay in the Union, though they warned Lincoln that they would not support an invasion through their territory. The seven Confederate states seceded before Lincoln took office, declaring themselves to be a new nation, the Confederate States of America. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy.. President-elect Lincoln evaded possible assassins in Baltimore, and on February 23, 1861, arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C. At his inauguration on March 4, 1861, the German American Turners formed Lincoln's bodyguard; and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present, ready to protect the capital from Confederate invasion and local insurrection.. Photograph showing the March 4, 1861, inauguration of Abraham Lincoln in front of United States Capitol.. In his First Inaugural Address, Lincoln declared, \"I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments,\" arguing further that the purpose of the United States Constitution was \"to form a more perfect union\" than the Articles of Confederation which were explicitly perpetual, thus the Constitution too was perpetual. He asked rhetorically that even were the Constitution a simple contract, would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?. Also in his inaugural address, in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war, Lincoln supported the pending Corwin Amendment to the Constitution, which had already passed Congress. This amendment, which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it existed, was designed to appeal not to the Confederacy but to the critical border states. At the same time, Lincoln adamantly opposed the Crittenden Compromise, which would have permitted slavery in the territories. Despite support for the Crittenden compromise among some prominent Republicans (including William Seward), Lincoln denounced it saying that it \"would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people, tribe, and state owning a foot of land between here and Tierra del Fuego.\". By the time Lincoln took office, the Confederacy was an established fact, and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. No compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. Lincoln might have allowed the southern states to secede, and some Republicans recommended that. However, conservative Democratic nationalists, such as Jeremiah S. Black, Joseph Holt, and Edwin M. Stanton had taken control of Buchanan's cabinet around January 1, 1861, and refused to accept secession. Lincoln and nearly every Republican leader adopted this position by March 1861: the Union could not be dismantled. However, as a strict follower of the constitution, Lincoln refused to take any action against the South unless the Unionists themselves were attacked first. This finally happened in April 1861.. Historian Allan Nevins argues that Lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the Union, hold government property, and still avoid war. He \"temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis,\" overestimated the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South and border states, and misunderstood the conditional support of Unionists in the border states.  Allan Nevins, The Improvised War, 1861-1862 (1959) p 29. In April 1861, after Union troops at Fort Sumter were fired upon and forced to surrender, Lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and \"preserve the Union,\" which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. Virginia, which had repeatedly warned Lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state, responded by seceding, along with North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas.. The slave states of Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware did not secede, and Lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there, promising not to interfere with slavery. After the fighting started, he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas (especially in Maryland) and held in military prisons without trial. Over 18,000 were arrested, though none were executed. One, Clement Vallandigham, was exiled; but all of the remainder were released, usually after two or three months (see: Ex parte Merryman).. Lincoln met with his cabinet for the first reading of the Emancipation Proclamation draft on July 22, 1862. L-R: Edwin M. Stanton, Salmon P. Chase, Abraham Lincoln, Gideon Welles, Caleb B. Smith, William H. Seward, Montgomery Blair and Edward Bates. In July 1862, Congress moved to free the slaves by passing the Second Confiscation Act. The goal was to weaken the rebellion, which was led and controlled by slave owners. While it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery (the Thirteenth Amendment did that), the Act showed that Lincoln had the support of Congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. This new law was implemented with Lincoln's \"Emancipation Proclamation.\". Lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the United States. In 1861 – 1862, however, he made it clear that the North was fighting the war to preserve the Union, not to abolish slavery. Freeing the slaves became, in late 1862, a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. Abolitionists criticized Lincoln for his sluggishness over slavery per se, but on August 22, 1862, Lincoln explained:. The Emancipation Proclamation, announced on September 22 and put into effect on January 1, 1863, freed slaves in territories not under Union control. As Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all of them in Confederate hands (over three million) were freed. Lincoln later said: \"I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.\" The proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. Lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation. Lincoln addressed the issue of his consistency in an 1864 letter to Albert G. Hodges.  Letter to Albert G. Hodges, April 4, 1864. In September 1862, thirteen northern governors met in Altoona, Pennsylvania, at the Loyal War Governors' Conference to discuss the Proclamation and Union war effort. In the end, the state executives fully supported the president's Proclamation and also suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union's Army of the Potomac.  Images of America: Altoona, by Sr. Anne Francis Pulling, 2001, 10.. For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. As Frederick Douglass observed, Lincoln was, \"The first great man that I talked with in the United States freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself, of the difference of color.\" Life and Times of Frederick Douglass, by Frederick Douglass, 1895. After Union victories at Gettysburg, Vicksburg and Chattanooga in 1863, victory seemed at hand, and Lincoln promoted Ulysses S. Grant General-in-Chief ( March 12, 1864). When the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates, Lincoln supported Grant's strategy of wearing down Lee's Confederate army at the cost of heavy Union casualties. With an election looming, he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. At the Convention, the Republican Party selected Andrew Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. They ran on the new Union Party ticket uniting Republicans and War Democrats.. Lincoln, in top hat, with Allan Pinkerton and Gen. John Alexander McClernand at Antietam.. Nevertheless, Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Acknowledging this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would nonetheless defeat the Confederacy by an all-out military effort before turning over the White House: Mark Grimsley and Brooks D Simpson, eds. The Collapse of the Confederacy (2001) p 80. Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.. While the Democratic platform followed the Peace wing of the party and called the war a \"failure,\" their candidate, General George B. McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform.. Lincoln provided Grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to support Grant and win local support for the war effort. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September ended defeatist jitters; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln; the Union party was united and energized, and Lincoln was easily reelected in a landslide. He won all but two states, capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.. On March 4 1865, Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address, his favorite of all his speeches. At this time, a victory over the rebels was at hand, slavery was dead, and Lincoln was looking to the future.. “Running the ‘Machine’”. An 1864 cartoon featuring Lincoln, William Fessenden, Edwin Stanton, William Seward and Gideon Welles takes a swing at the Lincoln administration. The war was a source of constant frustration for the president, and occupied nearly all of his time. He had a contentious relationship with General McClellan, who became general-in-chief of all the Union armies in the wake of the embarrassing Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run and after the retirement of Winfield Scott in late 1861. Despite his inexperience in military affairs, Lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. His priorities were twofold: to ensure that Washington, D.C., was well defended; and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the Northern public and press. McClellan, a youthful West Point graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service, took a more cautious approach. He took several months to plan and execute his Peninsula Campaign, with the objective of capturing Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula between the James and York Rivers. McClellan's delay irritated Lincoln, as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend Washington, D.C. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops to defend the capital, a decision McClellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.. McClellan, a lifelong Democrat who was temperamentally conservative, was relieved as general-in-chief after releasing his Harrison's Landing Letter, where he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint John Pope, a Republican, as head of the new Army of Virginia. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack. But Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. In response to his failure, Pope was sent to Minnesota to fight the Sioux.. An 1864 Mathew Brady photo depicts President Lincoln reading a book with his youngest son, Tad. Panicked by Lee's invasion of Maryland, Lincoln restored McClellan to command of all forces around Washington in time for the Battle of Antietam (September 1862). The ensuing Union victory enabled Lincoln to release his Emancipation Proclamation, but he relieved McClellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed Republican Ambrose Burnside to head the Army of the Potomac. Burnside had promised to follow through on Lincoln's strategic vision for a strong offensive against Lee and Richmond. After Burnside was stunningly defeated at Fredericksburg, Joseph Hooker was given the command, despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders.  Joseph Hooker biography  Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville (May 1863), and relieved of command early in the subsequent Gettysburg Campaign replaced by George Meade.. After the Union victory at Gettysburg, Meade's failure to pursue Lee and months of inactivity for the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to bring in a western general, Ulysses S. Grant. Grant already had a solid string of victories in the Western Theater, including the battles of Vicksburg and Chattanooga. Responding to criticism of Grant, Lincoln was quoted as saying, \"I cannot spare this man. He fights.\" Grant waged his bloody Overland Campaign in 1864 with a strategy of a war of attrition, characterized by high Union losses at battles such as the Wilderness and Cold Harbor, but by proportionately higher Confederate losses. His invasion campaign eventually bottled Lee up in the Siege of Petersburg, so that Grant could take Richmond, and bring the war to a close in the spring of 1865.. Lincoln authorized Grant to target civilians and infrastructure, hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. This allowed Generals Sherman and Sheridan to destroy farms and towns in the Shenandoah Valley, Georgia, and South Carolina. The damage caused by Sherman's March to the Sea through Georgia totaled in excess of $100 million by Sherman's own estimate. See Hofstadter, Richard, The United States: The History of a Republic, Prentice-Hall, 1967, p. 446.. Lincoln had a star-crossed record as a military leader, possessing a keen understanding of strategic points (such as the Mississippi River and the fortress city of Vicksburg) and the importance of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing cities. He had, however, limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863, when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in Ulysses S. Grant. Only then could he insist on using African American troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.. Throughout the war, Lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. He spent hours at the War Department telegraph office, reading dispatches from his generals. He visited battle sites frequently, and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. During Jubal Anderson Early's raid on Washington, D.C. in 1864, Lincoln had to be told to duck to avoid being shot while observing the battle.. Reconstruction began during the war as Lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the Southern states and what to do with Confederate leaders and the freed slaves. Lincoln led the \"moderates\" regarding Reconstructionist policy, and was usually opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Thaddeus Stevens in the House and Charles Sumner and Benjamin Wade in the Senate (though he cooperated with these men on most other issues). Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind Union lines. His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.  /ref&gt; Critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. Of special importance were Tennessee, where Lincoln appointed Andrew Johnson as governor, and Louisiana, where Lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. The Radicals thought this policy too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864. When Lincoln pocket-vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.  Donald (1995) ch. 20. On April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House in Virginia, and the war was effectively over. The other rebel armies surrendered soon after, and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare. Lincoln went to Richmond to make a public gesture of sitting at Jefferson Davis's own desk, symbolically saying to the nation that the President of the United States held authority over the entire land. He was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves, whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer's quote, \"I know I am free for I have seen the face of Father Abraham and have felt him.\" When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, Lincoln replied, \"Let 'em up easy.\"  Donald (1995) 576, 580,   \"President Lincoln Enters Richmond, 1865\" EyeWitness to History, www.eywitnesstohistory.com (2000).. One of the last photographs of Lincoln, likely taken between February and April 1865. Lincoln's powerful rhetoric defined the issues of the war for the nation, the world, and posterity. His extraordinary command of the English language was evidenced in the Gettysburg Address, a speech dedicating the cemetery at Gettysburg that he delivered on November 19, 1863. The speech defied Lincoln's own prediction that \"the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here.\" Lincoln's second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted. In these speeches, Lincoln articulated better than anyone else the rationale behind the Union cause.. In recent years, historians have stressed Lincoln's use of and redefinition of republican values. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln shifted emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism.  Jaffa (2000) p. 399  The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, rather than the Constitution's tolerance of slavers, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.\"  John Patrick Diggins, The Lost Soul of American Politics: Virtue, Self-interest, and the Foundations of Liberalism (1986) p. 307.  His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.  Foner (1970) p. 215 says, \"Lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism.\"  See also McPherson (1992) pp.61-64.  Nevertheless, in 1861 Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a \"republican form of government\" in every state. Jaffa (2000) p. 263  That duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in Reconstruction.. Lincoln's second inauguration on March 4, 1865. In the photo, Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth, can be seen in the crowd at the top and accomplices David Herold, Lewis Powell, George Atzerodt, John Surratt and Edmund Spangler in the bottom crowd. In his Gettysburg Address Lincoln redefined the American nation, arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776, \"conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\" He declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality, \"that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\" By emphasizing the centrality of the nation, he rebuffed the claims of state sovereignty. While some critics say Lincoln moved too far and too fast,  H.L. Mencken said \"It is difficult to imagine anything more untrue. The Union soldiers in the battle actually fought against self-determination; it was the Confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves.\" Mencken did not mention the right of self-determination rights for blacks.   they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked \"a new founding of the nation.\"  Wills (1992) p. 39.. During the Civil War, Lincoln appropriated powers no previous President had wielded: he used his war powers to proclaim a blockade, suspended the writ of habeas corpus, spent money without congressional authorization, and imprisoned 18,000 suspected Confederate sympathizers without trial. Nearly all of his actions, although vehemently denounced by the Copperheads, were subsequently upheld by Congress and the Courts.. Lincoln believed in the Whig theory of the presidency, which left Congress to write the laws while he signed them, vetoing only those bills that threatened his war powers. Thus, he signed the Homestead Act in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in 1869. Other important legislation involved economic matters, including the first income tax and higher tariffs. Also included was the creation of the system of national banks by the National Banking Acts of 1863, 1864, and 1865, which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system.  Congress created and Lincoln approved the Department of Agriculture in 1862, although that institution would not become a Cabinet-level department until 1889.. The Legal Tender Act of 1862 established the United States Note, the first paper currency in United States history.  This was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.. During the war, Lincoln's Treasury Department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied South—the most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.. In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope, to put down the \"Sioux Uprising\" in Minnesota. Presented with 303 death warrants for convicted Santee Dakota who had massacred innocent farmers, Lincoln affirmed 39 of these for execution (one was later reprieved).. The assassination of Abraham Lincoln. From left to right: Henry Rathbone, Clara Harris, Mary Todd Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth. Originally, John Wilkes Booth, a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland, had formulated a plan to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and determined to assassinate the president. Harrison, Lowell Hayes, Lincoln of Kentucky, University Press of Kentucky, 2000, pp. 3–4. ISBN 0813121566.  Learning that the President and First Lady, together with the Grants, would be attending Ford's Theatre, he laid his plans, assigning his co-conspirators to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward.. Without his main bodyguard Ward Hill Lamon, to whom he related his famous dream regarding his own assassination, Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14, 1865. As a lone bodyguard wandered, and Lincoln sat in his state box (Box 7) in the balcony, Booth crept up behind the President and waited for the funniest line of the play, hoping the laughter would muffle the noise of the gunshot. When the laughter began, Booth jumped into the box and aimed a single-shot, round-slug .44 caliber Henry Deringer at his head, firing at point-blank range. Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth but was cut by Booth's knife. Booth then leapt to the stage and shouted \"Sic semper tyrannis!\" (Latin: \"Thus always to tyrants\") and escaped, despite a broken leg suffered in the leap. George Alfred Townsend, The Life, Crime and Capture of John Wilkes Booth. New York: Dick &amp; Fitzgerald, 1865. (LCCN  12002580.  A twelve-day manhunt ensued, in which Booth was chased by Federal agents (under the direction of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton). He was eventually cornered in a Virginia barn house  and shot, dying of his wounds soon after.. An army surgeon, Doctor Charles Leale, initially assessed Lincoln's wound as mortal. The President was taken across the street from the theater to the Petersen House, where he lay in a coma for nine hours before he died. Several physicians attended Lincoln, including U.S. Army Surgeon General Joseph K. Barnes of the Army Medical Museum. Using a probe, Barnes located some fragments of Lincoln's skull and the ball lodged 6 inches (15 cm) inside his brain. Lincoln never regained consciousness and was officially pronounced dead at 7:22:10 a.m. April 15, 1865 at the age of 56. There is some disagreement among historians as to Stanton's words after Lincoln died. All agree that he began \"Now he belongs to the...\" with some stating he said \"ages\" while others believe he said \"angels.\"  After Lincoln's body was returned to the White House, his body was prepared for his lying in repose in the East Room. He was the first president to lie in state.. The Army Medical Museum, now named the National Museum of Health and Medicine, has retained in its collection several artifacts relating to the assassination. Currently on display are the bullet that was fired from the Derringer pistol, the probe used by Barnes, pieces of Lincoln's skull and hair, and the surgeon's cuff stained with Lincoln's blood.. Lincoln's funeral train carried his remains, as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son William, 1,654 miles (2,661 km) to Illinois . Lincoln's body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to Illinois.  While much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the United States, Copperheads celebrated the death of a man they considered an unconstitutional tyrant. The Lincoln Tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, is 177 feet (54 m) tall and, by 1874, was surmounted with several bronze statues of Lincoln. To prevent repeated attempts to steal Lincoln's body and hold it for ransom, Robert Todd Lincoln had Lincoln exhumed and reinterred in concrete several feet thick in 1901.. With over 120 photographs taken of him, Lincoln was the most photographed man in the United States up to the time he was assassinated.. Lincoln was known for appointing political rivals to high positions in his cabinet to keep in line all factions of his party — and to let them battle each other and not combine against Lincoln. Historians agree that except for Simon Cameron, it was a highly effective group.. Abraham Lincoln's official White House portrait. Lincoln appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States:. In March 1860 in a speech in New Haven, Connecticut, Lincoln said, with respect to slavery, “Whenever this question shall be settled, it must be settled on some philosophical basis. No policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained.\" The philosophical basis for Lincoln’s beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that Lincoln be examined \"seriously as a man of ideas.\" Lincoln was a strong supporter of the American Whig version of liberal capitalism who, more than most politicians of the time, was able to express his ideas within the context of Nineteenth Century religious beliefs. Guelzo pg. 18-19. There were few people who strongly or directly influenced Lincoln’s moral and intellectual development and perspectives. There was no teacher, mentor, church leader, community leader, or peer that Lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. Lacking a formal education, Lincoln’s personal philosophy was shaped by \"an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning.\" It was Lincoln’s reading, rather than his relationships, that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs. Guelzo pg. 20. Miller pg. 57-59  Lincoln’s reading and study of the Bible was an integral part of his intellectual roots.. Lincoln did, even as a boy, largely reject organized religion, but the Calvinistic \"doctrine of necessity\" would remain a factor throughout his life. In 1846 Lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as \"that the human mind is impelled to action, or held in rest by some power, over which the mind itself has no control.\" Donald pg. 15. The quote came from a letter to the public in which Lincoln was denying charges by a political opponent that he was a “religious scoffer.”  In April 1864, in justifying his actions in regard to Emancipation, Lincoln wrote, \"I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of three years struggle the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. God alone can claim it.\" Donald pg. 514. As Lincoln matured, and especially during his term as president, the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. On a personal level, the death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace. Wilson pg. 251-254  After Willie’s death, in the summer or early fall of 1862, Lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary:. Lincoln’s religious skepticism was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the Lockean Enlightenment and classical liberalism, especially economic liberalism. Guelzo pg. 20  Consistent with the common practice of the Whig party, Lincoln would often use the Declaration of Independence as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies. Guelzo pg.194  In a February 22, 1861 speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia Lincoln said,. He found in the Declaration justification for Whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the nativist platform of the Know Nothings. In claiming that all men were created free, Lincoln and the Whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement, expanded education, territory to grow, and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population. Guelzo pg.194-195. It was the Declaration of Independence, rather than the Bible, that Lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. He saw the Declaration as more than a political document. To him, as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders, it was, foremost, a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation. Miller pg. 297. While Lincoln is usually portrayed bearded, he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year-old Grace Bedell. Lincoln's death made the President a martyr to many. Repeated polls of historians have ranked Lincoln as among the greatest presidents in U.S. history, often appearing in the first position. Among contemporary admirers, Lincoln is usually seen as personifying classical values of honesty and integrity, as well as respect for individual and minority rights, and human freedom in general.. Many American organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image, with interests ranging from the gay rights-supporting Log Cabin Republicans to the insurance corporation Lincoln National Corporation. The Lincoln automobile is also named after him. The ballistic missile submarine Abraham Lincoln (SSBN-602) and the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) were named in his honor. Also, the Liberty ship, SS Nancy Hanks was named to honor his mother. During the Spanish Civil War the American faction of the International Brigades named themselves the Abraham Lincoln Brigade after Lincoln.. Lincoln has been memorialized in many city names, notably the capital of Nebraska. Lincoln, Illinois, is the only city to be named for Abraham Lincoln before he became President. Lincoln's name and image appear in numerous places. These include the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., the U.S. Lincoln $5 bill and the Lincoln cent, Lincoln's sculpture on the Mount Rushmore, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois. In addition, New Salem, Illinois (a reconstruction of Lincoln's early adult hometown), Ford's Theatre, and Petersen House (where he died) are all preserved as museums. The Lincoln Shrine in Redlands, California, is located behind the A.K. Smiley Public Library. The state nickname for Illinois is Land of Lincoln.. Counties in 19 U.S. states (Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) are named after Lincoln.. Abraham Lincoln's birthday, February 12, was formerly a national holiday, now commemorated as Presidents' Day. However, it is still observed in Illinois and many other states as a separate legal holiday, Lincoln's Birthday. A dozen states have legal holidays celebrating the third Monday in February as 'Presidents' Day' as a combination Washington-Lincoln Day.. To commemorate his upcoming 200th birthday in February 2009, Congress established the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission (ALBC) in 2000. Dedicated to renewing American appreciation of Lincoln’s legacy, the 15-member commission is made up of lawmakers and scholars and also features an adivsory board of over 130 various Lincoln historians and enthusiasts. Located at Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., the ALBC is the organizing force behind numerous tributes, programs and cultural events highlighting a two-year celebration scheduled to begin in February 2008 at Lincoln’s birthplace:  Hodgenville, Kentucky.. Lincoln's birthplace and family home are national historic memorials: the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site in Hodgenville, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois. The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum opened in Springfield in 2005; it is a major tourist attraction, with state-of-the-art exhibits.

As an outspoken opponent of the expansion of slavery in the United States, \"[I]n his short autobiography written for the 1860 presidential campaign, Lincoln would describe his protest in the Illinois legislature as one that 'briefly defined his position on the slavery question, and so far as it goes, it was then the same that it is now.\" This was in reference to the anti-expansion sentiments he had then expressed. Doris Kearns Goodwin, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln (2005) p. 91.  Holzer pg. 232.  Writing of the Cooper Union  speech, Holzer notes, \"Cooper Union proved a unique confluence of political culture, rhetorical opportunity, technological innovation, and human genius, and it brought Abraham Lincoln to the center stage of American politics at precisely the right time and place, and with precisely the right message: that slavery was wrong, and ought to be confined to the areas where it already existed, and placed on the 'course of ultimate extinction... .'\"  Lincoln won the Republican Party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year. During his term, he helped preserve the United States by leading the defeat of the secessionist Confederate States of America in the American Civil War. He introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery, issuing his Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1865.. Lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including Ulysses S. Grant. Historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the Republican Party well, bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. Lincoln successfully defused a war scare with the United Kingdom in 1861. Under his leadership, the Union took control of the border slave states at the start of the war. Additionally, he managed his own reelection in the 1864 presidential election.. Opponents of the war (also known as \"Copperheads\") criticized him for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans, an abolitionist faction of the Republican Party, criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. Even with these problems, Lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches; his Gettysburg Address is but one example of this. At the close of the war, Lincoln held a moderate view of Reconstruction, seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. His assassination in 1865 was the first presidential assassination in U.S. history and made him a martyr for the ideal of national unity.. Scholars now rank Lincoln among the top three U.S. Presidents, with the majority of those surveyed placing him first. He is noted for his lasting influence on U.S. politics, including a redefinition of republicanism.  As Diggins explains, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.\" John Patrick Diggins, The Lost Soul of American Politics: Virtue, Self-interest, and the Foundations of Liberalism (1986) p. 307. Foner (1970) p. 215 noted that, \"Lincoln stressed the moral basis of Republicanism.\" Jaffa (2000) p. 399, stresses Lincoln's emphasis on the Declaration of Independence as what Lincoln called the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism. See also McPherson (1992) pp.61-64.. Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, to Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks, two uneducated farmers. Lincoln was born in a one-room log cabin on the   Sinking Spring Farm, in southeast Hardin County, Kentucky (now part of LaRue County). This area was at the time considered the \"frontier.\" The name \"Abraham\" was chosen to commemorate his grandfather, who was killed in an American Indian raid in 1786. Donald (1995) p 21  His elder sister, Sarah Lincoln, was born in 1807; a younger brother, Thomas Jr, died in infancy. It is sometimes debated whether Lincoln had Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of the connective tissue characterized by long limbs and great physical stature.  Marfan syndrome: Introduction Aug 1, 2006. Symbolic log cabin at Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site.. For some time, Thomas Lincoln was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the Kentucky back country. He had purchased the Sinking Spring Farm in December of 1808 for $200 cash and assumption of a debt.  The farm site is now preserved as part of Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site.  The family belonged to a Baptist church that had seceded from a larger church over the issue of slavery. Though Lincoln was exposed to his parents' anti-slavery sentiment from a very young age, he never joined their church, or any other church for that matter.  As a youth he had little use for religion. Life of Abraham Lincoln, Colonel Ward H. Lamon, 1872 - portions reprinted in  Chapter VIII: Abraham Lincoln, Deist, and Admirer of Thomas Paine, From the book Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents by Franklin Steiner (1936). Lincoln was just seven years old when, in 1816, the family was forced to make a new start in Perry County (now in Spencer County), Indiana. He later noted that this move was \"partly on account of slavery,\" and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in Kentucky: Unlike land in the Northwest Territory, Kentucky never had a proper U.S. survey, and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property. Lincoln was only nine when his mother, then thirty-four years old, died of milk sickness. Soon afterwards, his father remarried  to Sarah Bush Johnston. Sarah Lincoln raised young Lincoln like one of her own children. Years later she compared Lincoln to her own son, saying \"Both were good boys, but I must say — both now being dead that Abe was the best boy I ever saw or ever expect to see.\" Lincoln was affectionate toward his stepmother, whom he would call \"Mother\" for the rest of his life, but he was distant from his father.  Donald, (1995) pp. 28, 152.. In 1830, after more economic and land-title difficulties in Indiana, the family settled on public land  /ref&gt; in Macon County, Illinois. Some scholars believe that it was his father's repeated land-title difficulties and ensuing financial hardships that led young Lincoln to study law.  The following winter was desolate and especially brutal, and the family considered moving back to Indiana. The following year, when his father relocated the family to a new homestead in Coles County, Illinois, twenty-two-year-old Lincoln struck out on his own, canoeing down the Sangamon River to the village of New Salem in Sangamon County. Later that year, hired by New Salem businessman Denton Offutt and accompanied by friends, he took goods from New Salem to New Orleans via flatboat on the Sangamon, Illinois and Mississippi rivers. While in New Orleans, he may have witnessed a slave auction, though as a frequent visitor to Kentucky, he would have had several earlier opportunities to witness  similar sales.  Donald, (1995) ch. 2.. Lincoln's formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling. Largely self-educated, he read every book he could get his hands on, once walking.  just to borrow one  While his favorite book was The Life of George Washington, Lincoln mastered the Bible, Shakespeare, and English and American history, and developed a plain writing style that puzzled audiences more used to grandiose rhetoric. He was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an ax; some rails he had allegedly split in his youth were exhibited at the 1860 Republican National Convention, as the party celebrated the poor-boy-made-good theme. Lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals, even for food. Though he was unusually tall at  , 4 inches and strong, Lincoln spent so much time reading that some neighbors suspected he must be doing it to avoid strenuous manual labor.. Young Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln began his political career in 1832, at age 23, with an unsuccessful campaign for the Illinois General Assembly, as a member of the Whig Party.  He ran eighth in a field of 13 candidates.  The centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the Sangamon River. He believed that this would attract steamboat traffic, which would allow the sparsely populated, poorer areas along the river to flourish.. He was elected captain of an Illinois militia company drawn from New Salem during the Black Hawk War, and later wrote that he had not had \"any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction.\"  Thomas (1952) 32-34; Basler (1946) p. 551   Though he never saw combat, Lincoln did assist in burying the dead from the Battle of Stillman's Run the day after Major Isaiah Stillman's troops fled the field of battle.  Abraham Lincoln Online Retrieved on March 11, 2007. For several months, Lincoln ran a small store in New Salem, selling tea, coffee, sugar, salt, blue calico, brown muslin, straw hats and whiskey.  Beveridge (1928) 1:127-8  Later, he found work as village postmaster and as a surveyor.. In 1834, he won election to the state legislature, and after coming across the Commentaries on the Laws of England, began to teach himself law. Admitted to the bar in 1837, he moved to Springfield, Illinois, that same year and began to practice law with John T. Stuart. With a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and in his closing arguments, Lincoln became one of the most respected and successful lawyers in Illinois and grew steadily more prosperous.. He served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a representative from Sangamon County, and became a leader of the Illinois Whig party. In 1837, he made his first protest against slavery in the Illinois House, stating that the institution was \"founded on both injustice and bad policy.\"  Protest in Illinois Legislature on Slavery, p.75, March 3, 1837  It was also in this same year that Lincoln met Joshua Fry Speed, who would become his most intimate friend.. Lincoln wrote a series of anonymous letters, published in 1842 in the Sangamon Journal, mocking State Auditor and prominent Democrat James Shields. Shields would later become a U.S. senator, but when he learned that it was Lincoln who had been writing the barbs, he challenged him to a duel. As Shields was the challenger, Lincoln was granted the right to choose the weapon and specified \"Cavalry broad swords of the largest size.\" Much taller and with long arms, this gave him an overwhelming advantage over his opponent; however, the duel was called off at the last minute. Beveridge (1928) 1:349. Lincoln had been practicing with the broad sword.  Two years later, Lincoln entered law practice with William Herndon, a fellow Whig. In 1854, both men joined the fledgling Republican Party. Following Lincoln's death, Herndon began collecting stories about Lincoln and published them in Herndon's Lincoln.. The first photograph ever taken of Mary Lincoln, a daguerreotype by Shepherd in 1846.. On November 4 1842 Lincoln married Mary Todd, daughter of a prominent slave-owning family from Kentucky. The couple had four sons. Robert Todd Lincoln was born in Springfield, Illinois on 1 August, 1843. Their only child to survive into adulthood, young Robert attended Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard College. Robert died on July 26, 1926, in Manchester, Vermont.. The other Lincoln children were born in Springfield, Illinois, and died either during childhood or their teen years. Edward Baker Lincoln was born on March 10, 1846, and died on 1 February, 1850, also in Springfield. William Wallace Lincoln was born on December 21, 1850, and died on February 20, 1862 in Washington, D.C., during Pres. Lincoln's first term. Thomas \"Tad\" Lincoln was born on 4 April, 1853, and died on July 16, 1871 in Chicago.. Four of his wife's brothers fought for the Confederacy, with one wounded and another killed in action. Lieutenant David H. Todd, a half-brother of Mary Todd Lincoln, served as commandant of the Libby Prison camp during the war.. The first photograph ever taken of Abraham Lincoln, a daguerreotype taken by Shepherd in 1846.. A Whig and an admirer of party leader Henry Clay,  Lincoln was elected to a term in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1846. As a freshman House member, he was not a particularly powerful or influential figure. He spoke out against the Mexican-American War, which he attributed to President Polk's desire for \"military glory — that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood.\" He also challenged the President's claims regarding the Texas boundary and offered Spot Resolutions demanding to know on what \"spot\" on US soil that blood was first spilt.  Congressional Globe, 30th Session (1848) pp.93-95  In January of 1848, he was among the 82 Whigs who defeated 81 Democrats in a procedural vote on an amendment to send a routine resolution back to committee with instructions to add the words \"a war unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the President of the United States.\" The amendment passed, but the bill never reemerged from committee and was never finally voted upon.  House Journal, 30th Session (1848) pp.183-184. Lincoln later damaged his political reputation with a speech in which he declared, \"God of Heaven has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent, and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men, women, and children, and lay waste and pillage the land of the just.\" Two weeks later, President Polk sent a peace treaty to Congress. While no one in Washington paid any attention to Lincoln, the Democrats orchestrated angry outbursts from across his district, where the war was popular and many had volunteered. In Morgan County, resolutions were adopted in fervent support of the war and in wrathful denunciation of the \"treasonable assaults of guerrillas at home; party demagogues; slanderers of the President; defenders of the butchery at the Alamo; traducers of the heroism at San Jacinto.\"  Abe Lincoln resource page. Warned by his law partner, William Herndon, that the damage was mounting and irreparable, Lincoln decided not to run for reelection. In fact, in 1848 he campaigned vigorously for Zachary Taylor, the successful general whose atrocities he had denounced in January. Regardless, his statements were not easily forgotten, and would haunt him during the Civil War. These statements were also held against him when he applied for a position in the new Taylor administration. Instead, Taylor's people offered Lincoln various positions in the remote Oregon Territory, primarily the governorship. Acceptance of this offer would have ended his career in the rapidly growing state of Illinois, so Lincoln declined the position. Returning to Springfield, Lincoln gave up politics for several years and turned his energies to his law practice. During this time, he made many trips on horseback between various counties' courthouses. Beveridge, (1928) 1: 428-33; Donald (1995) p. 140-43.. In the 1920s historical markers were placed at the county lines along the route Lincoln traveled in the eight judicial district. This example is on the border of Piatt and DeWitt counties. By the mid-1850s, Lincoln's caseload focused largely on the competing transportation interests of river barges and railroads. In one prominent 1851 case, he represented the Alton &amp; Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with a shareholder, James A. Barret. Barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to the railroad on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. Lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest, that the newer route proposed by Alton &amp; Sangamon was superior and less expensive, and that accordingly, the corporation had a right to sue Barret for his delinquent payment. He won this case, and the decision by the Illinois Supreme Court was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the United States. Donald, (1995) ch. 6.. Possibly the most notable criminal trial of Lincoln's career as a lawyer came in 1858, when he defended William \"Duff\" Armstrong, who has been charged with murder. The case became famous for Lincoln's use of judicial notice--a rare tactic at that time--to show that an eyewitness had lied on the stand. After the witness testified to having seen the crime by moonlight, Lincoln produced a Farmers' Almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle that it could not have provided enough illumination to see anything clearly. Based almost entirely on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted. Donald (1995), 150-51. Lincoln was involved in more than 5,100 cases in Illinois alone during his 23-year legal career. Though many of these cases involved little more than filing a writ, others were more substantial and quite involved. Lincoln and his partners appeared before the Illinois State Supreme Court more than 400 times. During one trial, Lincoln's voir dire included a question to prospective jurors as to whether they were acquainted with counsel for the other side. When a few of them turned out to know the other lawyer, the judge interrupted, saying, \"Mr. Lincoln, you are wasting the time of the court. The fact that a prospective juror knows your opponent does not disqualify him.\". \"No, Your Honor, I understand that,\" Lincoln answered. \"I'm afraid that some of them might not know him, which would place me at a disadvantage.\". Lincoln returned to politics in response to the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854), which expressly repealed the limits on slavery's extent as determined by the Missouri Compromise (1820). Illinois Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, the most powerful man in the Senate, proposed popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse, and incorporated it into the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory, rather than have such a decision imposed on them by Congress.  Donald, (1995) ch. 7.. In a speech against the act, on October 16 1854, delivered in Peoria, Lincoln first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day:. Drawing on remnants of the old Whig, Free Soil, Liberty and Democratic parties, he was instrumental in forming the new Republican Party. In a stirring campaign, the Republicans carried Illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. Lincoln was the obvious choice, but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an ex-Democrat Lyman Trumbull.. In 1857-58, Douglas broke with President Buchanan, leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state. Accepting the Republican nomination for Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered his famous speech: \"'A house divided against itself cannot stand.'(Mark 3:25) I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.\"  A House Divided Against Itself Cannot Stand, June 1858  The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the north.. The 1858 campaign featured the Lincoln-Douglas debates, a nationally famous contest on slavery. Lincoln warned that the \"Slave Power\" was threatening the values of republicanism, while Douglas emphasized the supremacy of democracy, as set forth in his Freeport Doctrine, which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not. Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature reelected Douglas to the Senate. Nevertheless, Lincoln's eloquence transformed him into a national political star.. During the debates of 1858, the issue of race was often discussed. During a time period when few believed in racial egalitarianism, Stephen Douglas informed the crowds, \"If you desire Negro citizenship… if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves… then support Mr. Lincoln and the Black Republican party, who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro.\"  First Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Ottawa, Illinois, August 21, 1858  Lincoln countered that he was \"not in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races.\"  Fourth Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Charleston, Illinois, September 18, 1858  His opposition to slavery was opposition to the Slave Power, though this would change during the course of the Civil War. Donald, (1995) ch. 8.. On May 9-10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur. At this convention, Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.. \"The Rail Candidate,\" Lincoln's 1860 candidacy is held up by slavery issue (slave on left) and party organization (New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley on right). Photo of Lincoln taken February 27, 1860 in New York City by Mathew Brady, the day of his famous Cooper Union speech.. Entering the presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog, Lincoln was eventually chosen as the Republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. His expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase. His \"Western\" origins also appealed to the newer states: other contenders, especially those with more governmental experience, had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states, while Lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the West. Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government. Yet despite his Southern connections (his in-laws owned slaves), Lincoln misunderstood the depth of the revolution underway in the South and the emergence of Southern nationalism. Throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war, and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession.  Gabor S. Boritt, \"'And the War Came'? Abraham Lincoln and the Question of Individual Responsibility,\" Why the Civil War Came ed by Boritt (1996), pp 3-30.. Throughout the election, Lincoln did not campaign or give speeches. This was handled by the state and county Republican organizations, who used the latest techniques to sustain party enthusiasm and thus obtain high turnout. There was little effort to convert non-Republicans, and there was virtually no campaigning in the South except for a few border cities such as St. Louis, Missouri, and Wheeling, Virginia; indeed, the party did not even run a slate in most of the South. In the North, there were thousands of Republican speakers, tons of campaign posters and leaflets, and thousands of newspaper editorials. These focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, making the most of his boyhood poverty, his pioneer background, his native genius, and his rise from obscurity. His nicknames, \"Honest Abe\" and \"the Rail-Splitter,\" were exploited to the full. The goal was to emphasize the superior power of \"free labor,\" whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts.  Thomas (1952) p 216; Reinhard H. Luthin, The First Lincoln Campaign (1944); Nevins vol 4;. On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, John C. Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and John Bell of the new Constitutional Union Party. He was the first Republican president, winning entirely on the strength of his support in the North: he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the South, and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other Southern states. Lincoln gained 1,865,908 votes (39.9% of the total), for 180 electoral votes; Douglas, 1,380,202 (29.5%) for 12 electoral votes; Breckenridge, 848,019 (18.1%) for 72 electoral votes; and Bell, 590,901 (12.5%) for 39 electoral votes. There were fusion tickets in some states, but even if his opponents had combined in every state, Lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election.. As Lincoln's election became more likely, secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the Union. South Carolina took the lead, followed by six other cotton-growing states in the deep South. The upper South (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to and rejected the secessionist appeal. They decided to stay in the Union, though they warned Lincoln that they would not support an invasion through their territory. The seven Confederate states seceded before Lincoln took office, declaring themselves to be a new nation, the Confederate States of America. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy.. President-elect Lincoln evaded possible assassins in Baltimore, and on February 23, 1861, arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C. At his inauguration on March 4, 1861, the German American Turners formed Lincoln's bodyguard; and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present, ready to protect the capital from Confederate invasion and local insurrection.. Photograph showing the March 4, 1861, inauguration of Abraham Lincoln in front of United States Capitol.. In his First Inaugural Address, Lincoln declared, \"I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments,\" arguing further that the purpose of the United States Constitution was \"to form a more perfect union\" than the Articles of Confederation which were explicitly perpetual, thus the Constitution too was perpetual. He asked rhetorically that even were the Constitution a simple contract, would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?. Also in his inaugural address, in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war, Lincoln supported the pending Corwin Amendment to the Constitution, which had already passed Congress. This amendment, which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it existed, was designed to appeal not to the Confederacy but to the critical border states. At the same time, Lincoln adamantly opposed the Crittenden Compromise, which would have permitted slavery in the territories. Despite support for the Crittenden compromise among some prominent Republicans (including William Seward), Lincoln denounced it saying that it \"would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people, tribe, and state owning a foot of land between here and Tierra del Fuego.\". By the time Lincoln took office, the Confederacy was an established fact, and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. No compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. Lincoln might have allowed the southern states to secede, and some Republicans recommended that. However, conservative Democratic nationalists, such as Jeremiah S. Black, Joseph Holt, and Edwin M. Stanton had taken control of Buchanan's cabinet around January 1, 1861, and refused to accept secession. Lincoln and nearly every Republican leader adopted this position by March 1861: the Union could not be dismantled. However, as a strict follower of the constitution, Lincoln refused to take any action against the South unless the Unionists themselves were attacked first. This finally happened in April 1861.. Historian Allan Nevins argues that Lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the Union, hold government property, and still avoid war. He \"temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis,\" overestimated the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South and border states, and misunderstood the conditional support of Unionists in the border states.  Allan Nevins, The Improvised War, 1861-1862 (1959) p 29. In April 1861, after Union troops at Fort Sumter were fired upon and forced to surrender, Lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and \"preserve the Union,\" which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. Virginia, which had repeatedly warned Lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state, responded by seceding, along with North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas.. The slave states of Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware did not secede, and Lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there, promising not to interfere with slavery. After the fighting started, he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas (especially in Maryland) and held in military prisons without trial. Over 18,000 were arrested, though none were executed. One, Clement Vallandigham, was exiled; but all of the remainder were released, usually after two or three months (see: Ex parte Merryman).. Lincoln met with his cabinet for the first reading of the Emancipation Proclamation draft on July 22, 1862. L-R: Edwin M. Stanton, Salmon P. Chase, Abraham Lincoln, Gideon Welles, Caleb B. Smith, William H. Seward, Montgomery Blair and Edward Bates. In July 1862, Congress moved to free the slaves by passing the Second Confiscation Act. The goal was to weaken the rebellion, which was led and controlled by slave owners. While it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery (the Thirteenth Amendment did that), the Act showed that Lincoln had the support of Congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. This new law was implemented with Lincoln's \"Emancipation Proclamation.\". Lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the United States. In 1861 – 1862, however, he made it clear that the North was fighting the war to preserve the Union, not to abolish slavery. Freeing the slaves became, in late 1862, a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. Abolitionists criticized Lincoln for his sluggishness over slavery per se, but on August 22, 1862, Lincoln explained:. The Emancipation Proclamation, announced on September 22 and put into effect on January 1, 1863, freed slaves in territories not under Union control. As Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all of them in Confederate hands (over three million) were freed. Lincoln later said: \"I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.\" The proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. Lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation. Lincoln addressed the issue of his consistency in an 1864 letter to Albert G. Hodges.  Letter to Albert G. Hodges, April 4, 1864. In September 1862, thirteen northern governors met in Altoona, Pennsylvania, at the Loyal War Governors' Conference to discuss the Proclamation and Union war effort. In the end, the state executives fully supported the president's Proclamation and also suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union's Army of the Potomac.  Images of America: Altoona, by Sr. Anne Francis Pulling, 2001, 10.. For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. As Frederick Douglass observed, Lincoln was, \"The first great man that I talked with in the United States freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself, of the difference of color.\" Life and Times of Frederick Douglass, by Frederick Douglass, 1895. After Union victories at Gettysburg, Vicksburg and Chattanooga in 1863, victory seemed at hand, and Lincoln promoted Ulysses S. Grant General-in-Chief ( March 12, 1864). When the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates, Lincoln supported Grant's strategy of wearing down Lee's Confederate army at the cost of heavy Union casualties. With an election looming, he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. At the Convention, the Republican Party selected Andrew Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. They ran on the new Union Party ticket uniting Republicans and War Democrats.. Lincoln, in top hat, with Allan Pinkerton and Gen. John Alexander McClernand at Antietam.. Nevertheless, Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Acknowledging this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would nonetheless defeat the Confederacy by an all-out military effort before turning over the White House: Mark Grimsley and Brooks D Simpson, eds. The Collapse of the Confederacy (2001) p 80. Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.. While the Democratic platform followed the Peace wing of the party and called the war a \"failure,\" their candidate, General George B. McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform.. Lincoln provided Grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to support Grant and win local support for the war effort. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September ended defeatist jitters; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln; the Union party was united and energized, and Lincoln was easily reelected in a landslide. He won all but two states, capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.. On March 4 1865, Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address, his favorite of all his speeches. At this time, a victory over the rebels was at hand, slavery was dead, and Lincoln was looking to the future.. “Running the ‘Machine’”. An 1864 cartoon featuring Lincoln, William Fessenden, Edwin Stanton, William Seward and Gideon Welles takes a swing at the Lincoln administration. The war was a source of constant frustration for the president, and occupied nearly all of his time. He had a contentious relationship with General McClellan, who became general-in-chief of all the Union armies in the wake of the embarrassing Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run and after the retirement of Winfield Scott in late 1861. Despite his inexperience in military affairs, Lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. His priorities were twofold: to ensure that Washington, D.C., was well defended; and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the Northern public and press. McClellan, a youthful West Point graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service, took a more cautious approach. He took several months to plan and execute his Peninsula Campaign, with the objective of capturing Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula between the James and York Rivers. McClellan's delay irritated Lincoln, as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend Washington, D.C. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops to defend the capital, a decision McClellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.. McClellan, a lifelong Democrat who was temperamentally conservative, was relieved as general-in-chief after releasing his Harrison's Landing Letter, where he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint John Pope, a Republican, as head of the new Army of Virginia. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack. But Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. In response to his failure, Pope was sent to Minnesota to fight the Sioux.. An 1864 Mathew Brady photo depicts President Lincoln reading a book with his youngest son, Tad. Panicked by Lee's invasion of Maryland, Lincoln restored McClellan to command of all forces around Washington in time for the Battle of Antietam (September 1862). The ensuing Union victory enabled Lincoln to release his Emancipation Proclamation, but he relieved McClellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed Republican Ambrose Burnside to head the Army of the Potomac. Burnside had promised to follow through on Lincoln's strategic vision for a strong offensive against Lee and Richmond. After Burnside was stunningly defeated at Fredericksburg, Joseph Hooker was given the command, despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders.  Joseph Hooker biography  Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville (May 1863), and relieved of command early in the subsequent Gettysburg Campaign replaced by George Meade.. After the Union victory at Gettysburg, Meade's failure to pursue Lee and months of inactivity for the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to bring in a western general, Ulysses S. Grant. Grant already had a solid string of victories in the Western Theater, including the battles of Vicksburg and Chattanooga. Responding to criticism of Grant, Lincoln was quoted as saying, \"I cannot spare this man. He fights.\" Grant waged his bloody Overland Campaign in 1864 with a strategy of a war of attrition, characterized by high Union losses at battles such as the Wilderness and Cold Harbor, but by proportionately higher Confederate losses. His invasion campaign eventually bottled Lee up in the Siege of Petersburg, so that Grant could take Richmond, and bring the war to a close in the spring of 1865.. Lincoln authorized Grant to target civilians and infrastructure, hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. This allowed Generals Sherman and Sheridan to destroy farms and towns in the Shenandoah Valley, Georgia, and South Carolina. The damage caused by Sherman's March to the Sea through Georgia totaled in excess of $100 million by Sherman's own estimate. See Hofstadter, Richard, The United States: The History of a Republic, Prentice-Hall, 1967, p. 446.. Lincoln had a star-crossed record as a military leader, possessing a keen understanding of strategic points (such as the Mississippi River and the fortress city of Vicksburg) and the importance of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing cities. He had, however, limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863, when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in Ulysses S. Grant. Only then could he insist on using African American troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.. Throughout the war, Lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. He spent hours at the War Department telegraph office, reading dispatches from his generals. He visited battle sites frequently, and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. During Jubal Anderson Early's raid on Washington, D.C. in 1864, Lincoln had to be told to duck to avoid being shot while observing the battle.. Reconstruction began during the war as Lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the Southern states and what to do with Confederate leaders and the freed slaves. Lincoln led the \"moderates\" regarding Reconstructionist policy, and was usually opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Thaddeus Stevens in the House and Charles Sumner and Benjamin Wade in the Senate (though he cooperated with these men on most other issues). Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind Union lines. His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.  /ref&gt; Critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. Of special importance were Tennessee, where Lincoln appointed Andrew Johnson as governor, and Louisiana, where Lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. The Radicals thought this policy too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864. When Lincoln pocket-vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.  Donald (1995) ch. 20. On April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House in Virginia, and the war was effectively over. The other rebel armies surrendered soon after, and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare. Lincoln went to Richmond to make a public gesture of sitting at Jefferson Davis's own desk, symbolically saying to the nation that the President of the United States held authority over the entire land. He was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves, whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer's quote, \"I know I am free for I have seen the face of Father Abraham and have felt him.\" When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, Lincoln replied, \"Let 'em up easy.\"  Donald (1995) 576, 580,   \"President Lincoln Enters Richmond, 1865\" EyeWitness to History, www.eywitnesstohistory.com (2000).. One of the last photographs of Lincoln, likely taken between February and April 1865. Lincoln's powerful rhetoric defined the issues of the war for the nation, the world, and posterity. His extraordinary command of the English language was evidenced in the Gettysburg Address, a speech dedicating the cemetery at Gettysburg that he delivered on November 19, 1863. The speech defied Lincoln's own prediction that \"the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here.\" Lincoln's second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted. In these speeches, Lincoln articulated better than anyone else the rationale behind the Union cause.. In recent years, historians have stressed Lincoln's use of and redefinition of republican values. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln shifted emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism.  Jaffa (2000) p. 399  The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, rather than the Constitution's tolerance of slavers, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.\"  John Patrick Diggins, The Lost Soul of American Politics: Virtue, Self-interest, and the Foundations of Liberalism (1986) p. 307.  His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.  Foner (1970) p. 215 says, \"Lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism.\"  See also McPherson (1992) pp.61-64.  Nevertheless, in 1861 Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a \"republican form of government\" in every state. Jaffa (2000) p. 263  That duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in Reconstruction.. Lincoln's second inauguration on March 4, 1865. In the photo, Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth, can be seen in the crowd at the top and accomplices David Herold, Lewis Powell, George Atzerodt, John Surratt and Edmund Spangler in the bottom crowd. In his Gettysburg Address Lincoln redefined the American nation, arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776, \"conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\" He declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality, \"that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\" By emphasizing the centrality of the nation, he rebuffed the claims of state sovereignty. While some critics say Lincoln moved too far and too fast,  H.L. Mencken said \"It is difficult to imagine anything more untrue. The Union soldiers in the battle actually fought against self-determination; it was the Confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves.\" Mencken did not mention the right of self-determination rights for blacks.   they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked \"a new founding of the nation.\"  Wills (1992) p. 39.. During the Civil War, Lincoln appropriated powers no previous President had wielded: he used his war powers to proclaim a blockade, suspended the writ of habeas corpus, spent money without congressional authorization, and imprisoned 18,000 suspected Confederate sympathizers without trial. Nearly all of his actions, although vehemently denounced by the Copperheads, were subsequently upheld by Congress and the Courts.. Lincoln believed in the Whig theory of the presidency, which left Congress to write the laws while he signed them, vetoing only those bills that threatened his war powers. Thus, he signed the Homestead Act in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in 1869. Other important legislation involved economic matters, including the first income tax and higher tariffs. Also included was the creation of the system of national banks by the National Banking Acts of 1863, 1864, and 1865, which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system.  Congress created and Lincoln approved the Department of Agriculture in 1862, although that institution would not become a Cabinet-level department until 1889.. The Legal Tender Act of 1862 established the United States Note, the first paper currency in United States history.  This was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.. During the war, Lincoln's Treasury Department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied South—the most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.. In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope, to put down the \"Sioux Uprising\" in Minnesota. Presented with 303 death warrants for convicted Santee Dakota who had massacred innocent farmers, Lincoln affirmed 39 of these for execution (one was later reprieved).. The assassination of Abraham Lincoln. From left to right: Henry Rathbone, Clara Harris, Mary Todd Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth. Originally, John Wilkes Booth, a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland, had formulated a plan to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and determined to assassinate the president. Harrison, Lowell Hayes, Lincoln of Kentucky, University Press of Kentucky, 2000, pp. 3–4. ISBN 0813121566.  Learning that the President and First Lady, together with the Grants, would be attending Ford's Theatre, he laid his plans, assigning his co-conspirators to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward.. Without his main bodyguard Ward Hill Lamon, to whom he related his famous dream regarding his own assassination, Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14, 1865. As a lone bodyguard wandered, and Lincoln sat in his state box (Box 7) in the balcony, Booth crept up behind the President and waited for the funniest line of the play, hoping the laughter would muffle the noise of the gunshot. When the laughter began, Booth jumped into the box and aimed a single-shot, round-slug .44 caliber Henry Deringer at his head, firing at point-blank range. Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth but was cut by Booth's knife. Booth then leapt to the stage and shouted \"Sic semper tyrannis!\" (Latin: \"Thus always to tyrants\") and escaped, despite a broken leg suffered in the leap. George Alfred Townsend, The Life, Crime and Capture of John Wilkes Booth. New York: Dick &amp; Fitzgerald, 1865. (LCCN  12002580.  A twelve-day manhunt ensued, in which Booth was chased by Federal agents (under the direction of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton). He was eventually cornered in a Virginia barn house  and shot, dying of his wounds soon after.. An army surgeon, Doctor Charles Leale, initially assessed Lincoln's wound as mortal. The President was taken across the street from the theater to the Petersen House, where he lay in a coma for nine hours before he died. Several physicians attended Lincoln, including U.S. Army Surgeon General Joseph K. Barnes of the Army Medical Museum. Using a probe, Barnes located some fragments of Lincoln's skull and the ball lodged 6 inches (15 cm) inside his brain. Lincoln never regained consciousness and was officially pronounced dead at 7:22:10 a.m. April 15, 1865 at the age of 56. There is some disagreement among historians as to Stanton's words after Lincoln died. All agree that he began \"Now he belongs to the...\" with some stating he said \"ages\" while others believe he said \"angels.\"  After Lincoln's body was returned to the White House, his body was prepared for his lying in repose in the East Room. He was the first president to lie in state.. The Army Medical Museum, now named the National Museum of Health and Medicine, has retained in its collection several artifacts relating to the assassination. Currently on display are the bullet that was fired from the Derringer pistol, the probe used by Barnes, pieces of Lincoln's skull and hair, and the surgeon's cuff stained with Lincoln's blood.. Lincoln's funeral train carried his remains, as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son William, 1,654 miles (2,661 km) to Illinois . Lincoln's body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to Illinois.  While much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the United States, Copperheads celebrated the death of a man they considered an unconstitutional tyrant. The Lincoln Tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, is 177 feet (54 m) tall and, by 1874, was surmounted with several bronze statues of Lincoln. To prevent repeated attempts to steal Lincoln's body and hold it for ransom, Robert Todd Lincoln had Lincoln exhumed and reinterred in concrete several feet thick in 1901.. With over 120 photographs taken of him, Lincoln was the most photographed man in the United States up to the time he was assassinated.. Lincoln was known for appointing political rivals to high positions in his cabinet to keep in line all factions of his party — and to let them battle each other and not combine against Lincoln. Historians agree that except for Simon Cameron, it was a highly effective group.. Abraham Lincoln's official White House portrait. Lincoln appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States:. In March 1860 in a speech in New Haven, Connecticut, Lincoln said, with respect to slavery, “Whenever this question shall be settled, it must be settled on some philosophical basis. No policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained.\" The philosophical basis for Lincoln’s beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that Lincoln be examined \"seriously as a man of ideas.\" Lincoln was a strong supporter of the American Whig version of liberal capitalism who, more than most politicians of the time, was able to express his ideas within the context of Nineteenth Century religious beliefs. Guelzo pg. 18-19. There were few people who strongly or directly influenced Lincoln’s moral and intellectual development and perspectives. There was no teacher, mentor, church leader, community leader, or peer that Lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. Lacking a formal education, Lincoln’s personal philosophy was shaped by \"an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning.\" It was Lincoln’s reading, rather than his relationships, that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs. Guelzo pg. 20. Miller pg. 57-59  Lincoln’s reading and study of the Bible was an integral part of his intellectual roots.. Lincoln did, even as a boy, largely reject organized religion, but the Calvinistic \"doctrine of necessity\" would remain a factor throughout his life. In 1846 Lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as \"that the human mind is impelled to action, or held in rest by some power, over which the mind itself has no control.\" Donald pg. 15. The quote came from a letter to the public in which Lincoln was denying charges by a political opponent that he was a “religious scoffer.”  In April 1864, in justifying his actions in regard to Emancipation, Lincoln wrote, \"I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of three years struggle the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. God alone can claim it.\" Donald pg. 514. As Lincoln matured, and especially during his term as president, the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. On a personal level, the death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace. Wilson pg. 251-254  After Willie’s death, in the summer or early fall of 1862, Lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary:. Lincoln’s religious skepticism was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the Lockean Enlightenment and classical liberalism, especially economic liberalism. Guelzo pg. 20  Consistent with the common practice of the Whig party, Lincoln would often use the Declaration of Independence as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies. Guelzo pg.194  In a February 22, 1861 speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia Lincoln said,. He found in the Declaration justification for Whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the nativist platform of the Know Nothings. In claiming that all men were created free, Lincoln and the Whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement, expanded education, territory to grow, and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population. Guelzo pg.194-195. It was the Declaration of Independence, rather than the Bible, that Lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. He saw the Declaration as more than a political document. To him, as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders, it was, foremost, a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation. Miller pg. 297. While Lincoln is usually portrayed bearded, he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year-old Grace Bedell. Lincoln's death made the President a martyr to many. Repeated polls of historians have ranked Lincoln as among the greatest presidents in U.S. history, often appearing in the first position. Among contemporary admirers, Lincoln is usually seen as personifying classical values of honesty and integrity, as well as respect for individual and minority rights, and human freedom in general.. Many American organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image, with interests ranging from the gay rights-supporting Log Cabin Republicans to the insurance corporation Lincoln National Corporation. The Lincoln automobile is also named after him. The ballistic missile submarine Abraham Lincoln (SSBN-602) and the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) were named in his honor. Also, the Liberty ship, SS Nancy Hanks was named to honor his mother. During the Spanish Civil War the American faction of the International Brigades named themselves the Abraham Lincoln Brigade after Lincoln.. Lincoln has been memorialized in many city names, notably the capital of Nebraska. Lincoln, Illinois, is the only city to be named for Abraham Lincoln before he became President. Lincoln's name and image appear in numerous places. These include the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., the U.S. Lincoln $5 bill and the Lincoln cent, Lincoln's sculpture on the Mount Rushmore, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois. In addition, New Salem, Illinois (a reconstruction of Lincoln's early adult hometown), Ford's Theatre, and Petersen House (where he died) are all preserved as museums. The Lincoln Shrine in Redlands, California, is located behind the A.K. Smiley Public Library. The state nickname for Illinois is Land of Lincoln.. Counties in 19 U.S. states (Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) are named after Lincoln.. Abraham Lincoln's birthday, February 12, was formerly a national holiday, now commemorated as Presidents' Day. However, it is still observed in Illinois and many other states as a separate legal holiday, Lincoln's Birthday. A dozen states have legal holidays celebrating the third Monday in February as 'Presidents' Day' as a combination Washington-Lincoln Day.. To commemorate his upcoming 200th birthday in February 2009, Congress established the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission (ALBC) in 2000. Dedicated to renewing American appreciation of Lincoln’s legacy, the 15-member commission is made up of lawmakers and scholars and also features an adivsory board of over 130 various Lincoln historians and enthusiasts. Located at Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., the ALBC is the organizing force behind numerous tributes, programs and cultural events highlighting a two-year celebration scheduled to begin in February 2008 at Lincoln’s birthplace:  Hodgenville, Kentucky.. Lincoln's birthplace and family home are national historic memorials: the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site in Hodgenville, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois. The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum opened in Springfield in 2005; it is a major tourist attraction, with state-of-the-art exhibits.

              "      <td>Zebra. Plains zebra. Grevy's zebra. Zebras are African equids best known for their distinctive white and black stripes. Their stripes come in different patterns unique to each individual. They are generally social animals and can be seen in small harems to large herds. In addition to their stripes, zebras have erect, mohawk-like manes. Unlike their closest relatives, horses and asses, zebras have never been truly domesticated.. There are three species of zebra: the Plains Zebra, Grévy's Zebra and the Mountain Zebra. The Plains zebra and the Mountain zebra belong to the subgenus Hippotigris, but Grevy's zebra is the sole species of subgenus Dolichohippus. The latter resembles an ass while the former two are more horse-like. Nevertheless, DNA and molecular data show that zebras do indeed have monophyletic origins. All three belong to the genus Equus along with other living equids. In certain regions of Kenya, Plains zebras and Grevy's zebras coexist.. The unique stripes and behaviors of zebras make these among the animals most familiar to people. They can be found in a variety of habitats, such as grasslands, savannas, woodlands, thorny scrublands, mountains and coastal hills. However, various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations, in particular hunting for skins and habitat destruction. Grevy's zebra and the Mountain zebra are endangered. While Plains zebras are much more plentiful, one subspecies, the quagga, went extinct in the late nineteenth century.. The name \"zebra\" comes from the Old Portuguese word zevra which means \"wild ass\". The pronunciation is     internationally, or     in North America.. Zebras were the second lineage to diverge from the earliest proto-horses, after the asses, around 4 million years ago. Grevy's zebra is believed to have been the first zebra species to emerge. The ancestors of the Equus horses are believed to have been striped, and zebras must have retained the stripes of their ancestors due to their advantage for social animals in tropical environments. Extensive stripes would be of little use to equids that live in low densities in deserts (like asses and some horses) or ones that live in colder climates with shaggy coats and annual shading (like some horses).   Fossils of an ancient equid were discovered in the Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument in Hagerman, Idaho. It was named the Hagerman horse with a scientific name of Equus simplicidens. It is believed to have been similar to the Grevy's zebra.   The animals had stocky zebra-like bodies and short, narrow, donkey-like skulls.    Grevy's zebra also has a donkey-like skull. The Hagerman horse is also called the American zebra or Hagerman zebra.. Zebras in Botswana. There are three extant species. Collectively, two of the species have 8 subspecies (7 extant). Zebra populations are diverse, and the relationships between and the taxonomic status of several of the subspecies are not well known.. * Genus: Equus. ** Subgenus: Hippotigris. *** Plains Zebra, Equus quagga. **** Quagga, Equus quagga quagga (extinct). **** Burchell's Zebra, Equus quagga burchellii (includes Damara Zebra). **** Grant's Zebra, Equus quagga boehmi. **** Selous' Zebra, Equus quagga borensis. **** Chapman's Zebra, Equus quagga chapmani. **** Crawshay's Zebra, Equus quagga crawshayi. *** Mountain Zebra, Equus zebra. **** Cape Mountain Zebra, Equus zebra zebra. **** Hartmann's Mountain Zebra, Equus zebra hartmannae. ** Subgenus: Dolichohippus. *** Grévy's Zebra, Equus grevyi. An albino zebra in captivity. The Plains Zebra (Equus quagga, formerly Equus burchelli) is the most common, and has or had about twelve subspecies distributed across much of southern and eastern Africa. It, or particular subspecies of it, have also been known as the Common Zebra, the Dauw, Burchell's Zebra (actually the subspecies Equus quagga burchellii), Chapman's Zebra, Wahlberg's Zebra, Selous' Zebra, Grant's Zebra, Boehm's Zebra and the Quagga (another extinct subspecies, Equus quagga quagga).. The Mountain Zebra (Equus zebra) of southwest Africa tends to have a sleek coat with a white belly and narrower stripes than the Plains Zebra. It has two subspecies and is classified as vulnerable.. Grévy's Zebra (Equus grevyi) is the largest type, with a long, narrow head making it appear rather mule-like. It is an inhabitant of the semi-arid grasslands of Ethiopia and northern Kenya. Grévy's Zebra is the rarest species of zebra around today, and is classified as endangered.. Although zebra species may have overlapping ranges, they do not interbreed. This held true even when the Quagga and Burchell's race of Plains Zebra shared the same area. In captivity, Plains Zebras have been crossed with Mountain zebras. The hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the Plains Zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern. Attempts to breed a Grévy's Zebra stallion to Mountain Zebra mares resulted in a high rate of miscarriage. In captivity, crosses between zebras and other (non-zebra) equines have produced several distinct hybrids, including the zebroid, zeedonk, zony, and zorse.. It was previously believed that zebras were white animals with black stripes since some zebras have white underbellies. However embryological evidence shows that the animal's background color is dark and the white stripes and bellies are additions.. A mother nursing her young blends into a stand of deadwood.. The stripes are typically vertical on the head, neck, forequarters, and main body, with horizontal stripes at the rear and on the legs of the animal. The \"zebra crossing\" is named after the zebra's black and white stripes.. It has been suggested that the stripes serve as visual cues and identification.  With each striping pattern unique to each individual, zebras can recognize one another by their stripes.. Others believe that the stripes act as a camouflage mechanism. This is accomplished in several ways. First, the vertical striping helps the zebra hide in grass. While seeming absurd at first glance considering that grass is neither white nor black, it is supposed to be effective against the zebra's main predator, the lion, which is color blind. Theoretically a zebra standing still in tall grass may not be noticed at all by a lion. Additionally, since zebras are herd animals, the stripes may help to confuse predators - a number of zebras standing or moving close together may appear as one large animal, making it more difficult for the lion to pick out any single zebra to attack.    A herd of zebras scattering to avoid a predator will also represent to that predator a confused mass of vertical stripes travelling in multiple directions making it difficult for the predator to track an individual visually as it separates from its herdmates, although biologists have never observed lions appearing confused by zebra stripes.. A more recent theory, supported by experiment, posits that the disruptive colouration is also an effective means of confusing the visual system of the blood-sucking tsetse fly. Waage, J. K. (1981). How the zebra got its stripes: biting flies as selective agents in the evolution of zebra colouration. J. Entom. Soc. South Africa. 44: 351 - 358.  Alternative theories include that the stripes coincide with fat patterning beneath the skin, serving as a thermoregulatory mechanism for the zebra, and that wounds sustained disrupt the striping pattern to clearly indicate the fitness of the animal to potential mates.. A zebra walking. Like horses, zebras walk, trot, canter and gallop. They are generally slower than horses but their great stamina helps them outpace predators. When chased, a zebra will zig-zag from side to side making it more difficult for the predator. When cornered the zebra will rear up and kick or bite its attacker.. Closeup of a zebra. Zebras have excellent eyesight. It is believed that they can see in color. Like most ungulates the zebra has its eyes on the sides of its head, giving it a wide field of view. Zebras also have night vision, although not as advanced as that of most of their predators, but their hearing compensates.. Zebras have great hearing, and tend to have larger, rounder ears than horses. Like horses and other ungulates, zebra can turn their ears in almost any direction. In addition to eyesight and hearing, zebras have an acute sense of smell and taste.. Zebras in Tanzania. Like most members of the horse family, zebras are highly sociable. Their social structure, however, depends on the species. Mountain zebras and Plains zebras live in groups, known as 'harems', consisting of one stallion with up to six mares and their foals. Bachelor males either live alone or with groups of other bachelors until they are old enough to challenge a breeding stallion. When attacked by packs of hyenas or wild dogs, a zebra group will huddle together with the foals in the middle while the stallion tries to ward them off.. Unlike the other zebra species, Grevy's zebras do not have permanent social bonds. A group of these zebras rarely stays together for more than a few months. The foals stay with their mother, while the adult male lives alone. However like the other two zebra species, bachelor male zebras will organize in groups.. Like horses, zebras sleep standing up and only sleep when neighbors are around to warn them of predators.. A zebra feeding on grass. Zebras communicate with each other with high pitched barks and whinnying. Grevy's zebras make mule-like brays. A zebra’s ears signify its mood. When a zebra is in a calm, tense or friendly mood, its ears stand erect. When it is frightened, its ears are pushed forward. When angry, the ears are pulled backward. When surveying an area for predators, zebras will stand in an alert posture; with ears erect, head held high, and staring. When tense they will also snort. When a predator is spotted or sensed, a zebra will bark (or bray) loudly.. Mother and foal at the Dallas Zoo. Zebras are very adaptable grazers. They feed mainly on grasses but will also eat shrubs, herbs, twigs, leaves and bark. Their well adapted digestive system allows them to subsist on diets of lower nutritional quality than that necessary for herbivores.. Like most animal species, female zebras mature earlier than the males and a mare may have her first foal by the age of three. Males are not able to breed until the age of five or six. Mares may give birth to one foal every twelve months. She nurses the foal for up to a year. Like horses, zebras are able to stand, walk and suckle shortly after they're born. A zebra foal is brown and white instead of black and white at birth.. Plains and Mountain zebra foals are protected by their mother as well as the head stallion and the other mares in their group. Grevy’s zebra foals have only their mother as a regular protector since, as noted above, Grevy's zebra groups often disband after a few months.. Lord Rothschild with his famed zebra carriage (Equus burchelli), which he frequently drove through London. Attempts have been made to train zebras for riding since they have better resistance than horses to African diseases. However most of these attempts failed, due to the zebra's more unpredictable nature and tendency to panic under stress. For this reason, zebra-mules or zebroids (crosses between any species of zebra and a horse, pony, donkey or ass) are preferred over pure-bred zebras.. In England, the zoological collector Lord Rothschild frequently used zebras to draw a carriage. In 1907, Rosendo Ribeiro, the first doctor in Nairobi, Kenya, used a riding zebra for house-calls. In the mid 1800s Governor George Grey imported zebras to New Zealand from his previous posting in South Africa, and used them to pull his carriage on his privately owned Kawau Island.. A tamed zebra being ridden in East Africa. Captain Horace Hayes, in \"Points of the Horse\" (circa 1893) compared the usefulness of different zebra species. In 1891, Hayes broke a mature, intact Mountain Zebra stallion to ride in two days time, and the animal was quiet enough for his wife to ride and be photographed upon. He found the Burchell's zebra easy to break in and considered it ideal for domestication, as it was immune to the bite of the tsetse fly. He considered the quagga well-suited to domestication due to being easy to train to saddle and harness. Hayes, Capt. Horace (1893),  Points of the Horse, pp. 311-316, London: W. Thacker. Modern man has had great impact on the zebra population. Zebras were, and still are, hunted mainly for their skins. The Cape mountain zebra was hunted to near extinction with less than 100 individuals by the 1930s. However the population has increased to about 700 due to conservation efforts. Both Mountain zebra subspecies are currently protected in national parks but are still endangered.. Zebras on the Botswana coat of arms. The Grevy's zebra is also endangered. Hunting and competition from livestock have greatly decreased their population. Because of the population's small size, environmental hazards, such as drought, are capable of easily affecting the entire species. Plains zebras are much more numerous and have a healthy population. Nevertheless they too are threatened by hunting and habitat change from farming. One subspecies, the quagga, is now extinct.. Zebras have been the subject of African folk tales which tell how they got their stripes. According to a Bushmen folk tale of Namibia, the zebra was once all white but got its black stripes after a fight with a baboon over a waterhole. After kicking the baboon so hard the zebra lost his balance and tripped over a fire and the fire sticks left scorches mark all over this white coat.    In the film Fantasia, two centaurs are depicted being half human and half zebra, instead of the typical half human and half horse.. Illustration of a zebra by Ludolphus.

Their stripes come in different patterns unique to each individual. They are generally social animals and can be seen in small harems to large herds. In addition to their stripes, zebras have erect, mohawk-like manes. Unlike their closest relatives, horses and asses, zebras have never been truly domesticated.. There are three species of zebra: the Plains Zebra, Grévy's Zebra and the Mountain Zebra. The Plains zebra and the Mountain zebra belong to the subgenus Hippotigris, but Grevy's zebra is the sole species of subgenus Dolichohippus. The latter resembles an ass while the former two are more horse-like. Nevertheless, DNA and molecular data show that zebras do indeed have monophyletic origins. All three belong to the genus Equus along with other living equids. In certain regions of Kenya, Plains zebras and Grevy's zebras coexist.. The unique stripes and behaviors of zebras make these among the animals most familiar to people. They can be found in a variety of habitats, such as grasslands, savannas, woodlands, thorny scrublands, mountains and coastal hills. However, various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations, in particular hunting for skins and habitat destruction. Grevy's zebra and the Mountain zebra are endangered. While Plains zebras are much more plentiful, one subspecies, the quagga, went extinct in the late nineteenth century.. The name \"zebra\" comes from the Old Portuguese word zevra which means \"wild ass\". The pronunciation is     internationally, or     in North America.. Zebras were the second lineage to diverge from the earliest proto-horses, after the asses, around 4 million years ago. Grevy's zebra is believed to have been the first zebra species to emerge. The ancestors of the Equus horses are believed to have been striped, and zebras must have retained the stripes of their ancestors due to their advantage for social animals in tropical environments. Extensive stripes would be of little use to equids that live in low densities in deserts (like asses and some horses) or ones that live in colder climates with shaggy coats and annual shading (like some horses).

The Mountain Zebra (Equus zebra) of southwest Africa tends to have a sleek coat with a white belly and narrower stripes than the Plains Zebra. It has two subspecies and is classified as vulnerable.. Grévy's Zebra (Equus grevyi) is the largest type, with a long, narrow head making it appear rather mule-like. It is an inhabitant of the semi-arid grasslands of Ethiopia and northern Kenya. Grévy's Zebra is the rarest species of zebra around today, and is classified as endangered.. Although zebra species may have overlapping ranges, they do not interbreed. This held true even when the Quagga and Burchell's race of Plains Zebra shared the same area. In captivity, Plains Zebras have been crossed with Mountain zebras. The hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the Plains Zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern. Attempts to breed a Grévy's Zebra stallion to Mountain Zebra mares resulted in a high rate of miscarriage. In captivity, crosses between zebras and other (non-zebra) equines have produced several distinct hybrids, including the zebroid, zeedonk, zony, and zorse.. It was previously believed that zebras were white animals with black stripes since some zebras have white underbellies. However embryological evidence shows that the animal's background color is dark and the white stripes and bellies are additions.. A mother nursing her young blends into a stand of deadwood.. The stripes are typically vertical on the head, neck, forequarters, and main body, with horizontal stripes at the rear and on the legs of the animal. The \"zebra crossing\" is named after the zebra's black and white stripes.. It has been suggested that the stripes serve as visual cues and identification.  With each striping pattern unique to each individual, zebras can recognize one another by their stripes.. Others believe that the stripes act as a camouflage mechanism. This is accomplished in several ways. First, the vertical striping helps the zebra hide in grass. While seeming absurd at first glance considering that grass is neither white nor black, it is supposed to be effective against the zebra's main predator, the lion, which is color blind. Theoretically a zebra standing still in tall grass may not be noticed at all by a lion. Additionally, since zebras are herd animals, the stripes may help to confuse predators - a number of zebras standing or moving close together may appear as one large animal, making it more difficult for the lion to pick out any single zebra to attack.    A herd of zebras scattering to avoid a predator will also represent to that predator a confused mass of vertical stripes travelling in multiple directions making it difficult for the predator to track an individual visually as it separates from its herdmates, although biologists have never observed lions appearing confused by zebra stripes.. A more recent theory, supported by experiment, posits that the disruptive colouration is also an effective means of confusing the visual system of the blood-sucking tsetse fly. Waage, J. K. (1981). How the zebra got its stripes: biting flies as selective agents in the evolution of zebra colouration. J. Entom. Soc. South Africa. 44: 351 - 358.  Alternative theories include that the stripes coincide with fat patterning beneath the skin, serving as a thermoregulatory mechanism for the zebra, and that wounds sustained disrupt the striping pattern to clearly indicate the fitness of the animal to potential mates.. A zebra walking. Like horses, zebras walk, trot, canter and gallop. They are generally slower than horses but their great stamina helps them outpace predators. When chased, a zebra will zig-zag from side to side making it more difficult for the predator. When cornered the zebra will rear up and kick or bite its attacker.. Closeup of a zebra. Zebras have excellent eyesight. It is believed that they can see in color. Like most ungulates the zebra has its eyes on the sides of its head, giving it a wide field of view. Zebras also have night vision, although not as advanced as that of most of their predators, but their hearing compensates.. Zebras have great hearing, and tend to have larger, rounder ears than horses. Like horses and other ungulates, zebra can turn their ears in almost any direction. In addition to eyesight and hearing, zebras have an acute sense of smell and taste.. Zebras in Tanzania. Like most members of the horse family, zebras are highly sociable. Their social structure, however, depends on the species. Mountain zebras and Plains zebras live in groups, known as 'harems', consisting of one stallion with up to six mares and their foals. Bachelor males either live alone or with groups of other bachelors until they are old enough to challenge a breeding stallion. When attacked by packs of hyenas or wild dogs, a zebra group will huddle together with the foals in the middle while the stallion tries to ward them off.. Unlike the other zebra species, Grevy's zebras do not have permanent social bonds. A group of these zebras rarely stays together for more than a few months. The foals stay with their mother, while the adult male lives alone. However like the other two zebra species, bachelor male zebras will organize in groups.. Like horses, zebras sleep standing up and only sleep when neighbors are around to warn them of predators.. A zebra feeding on grass. Zebras communicate with each other with high pitched barks and whinnying. Grevy's zebras make mule-like brays. A zebra’s ears signify its mood. When a zebra is in a calm, tense or friendly mood, its ears stand erect. When it is frightened, its ears are pushed forward. When angry, the ears are pulled backward. When surveying an area for predators, zebras will stand in an alert posture; with ears erect, head held high, and staring. When tense they will also snort. When a predator is spotted or sensed, a zebra will bark (or bray) loudly.. Mother and foal at the Dallas Zoo. Zebras are very adaptable grazers. They feed mainly on grasses but will also eat shrubs, herbs, twigs, leaves and bark. Their well adapted digestive system allows them to subsist on diets of lower nutritional quality than that necessary for herbivores.. Like most animal species, female zebras mature earlier than the males and a mare may have her first foal by the age of three. Males are not able to breed until the age of five or six. Mares may give birth to one foal every twelve months. She nurses the foal for up to a year. Like horses, zebras are able to stand, walk and suckle shortly after they're born. A zebra foal is brown and white instead of black and white at birth.. Plains and Mountain zebra foals are protected by their mother as well as the head stallion and the other mares in their group. Grevy’s zebra foals have only their mother as a regular protector since, as noted above, Grevy's zebra groups often disband after a few months.. Lord Rothschild with his famed zebra carriage (Equus burchelli), which he frequently drove through London. Attempts have been made to train zebras for riding since they have better resistance than horses to African diseases. However most of these attempts failed, due to the zebra's more unpredictable nature and tendency to panic under stress. For this reason, zebra-mules or zebroids (crosses between any species of zebra and a horse, pony, donkey or ass) are preferred over pure-bred zebras.. In England, the zoological collector Lord Rothschild frequently used zebras to draw a carriage. In 1907, Rosendo Ribeiro, the first doctor in Nairobi, Kenya, used a riding zebra for house-calls. In the mid 1800s Governor George Grey imported zebras to New Zealand from his previous posting in South Africa, and used them to pull his carriage on his privately owned Kawau Island.. A tamed zebra being ridden in East Africa. Captain Horace Hayes, in \"Points of the Horse\" (circa 1893) compared the usefulness of different zebra species. In 1891, Hayes broke a mature, intact Mountain Zebra stallion to ride in two days time, and the animal was quiet enough for his wife to ride and be photographed upon. He found the Burchell's zebra easy to break in and considered it ideal for domestication, as it was immune to the bite of the tsetse fly. He considered the quagga well-suited to domestication due to being easy to train to saddle and harness. Hayes, Capt. Horace (1893),  Points of the Horse, pp. 311-316, London: W. Thacker. Modern man has had great impact on the zebra population. Zebras were, and still are, hunted mainly for their skins. The Cape mountain zebra was hunted to near extinction with less than 100 individuals by the 1930s. However the population has increased to about 700 due to conservation efforts. Both Mountain zebra subspecies are currently protected in national parks but are still endangered.. Zebras on the Botswana coat of arms. The Grevy's zebra is also endangered. Hunting and competition from livestock have greatly decreased their population. Because of the population's small size, environmental hazards, such as drought, are capable of easily affecting the entire species. Plains zebras are much more numerous and have a healthy population. Nevertheless they too are threatened by hunting and habitat change from farming. One subspecies, the quagga, is now extinct.. Zebras have been the subject of African folk tales which tell how they got their stripes. According to a Bushmen folk tale of Namibia, the zebra was once all white but got its black stripes after a fight with a baboon over a waterhole. After kicking the baboon so hard the zebra lost his balance and tripped over a fire and the fire sticks left scorches mark all over this white coat.    In the film Fantasia, two centaurs are depicted being half human and half zebra, instead of the typical half human and half horse.. Illustration of a zebra by Ludolphus. Zebra are a popular subject in art.    The fourth Mughal emperor Jahangir (r.1605-24), commissioned a painting of the zebra, which was completed by Ustad Mansur. Cohen, M.J.

When in movies and cartoons zebras are most often miscellaneous characters but have had some starring roles, notably in Madagascar and Racing Stripes. Zebras are also serve as mascots and symbols for products and corporations, notably Zebra Technologies and Fruit Stripe gum.

Their stripes come in different patterns unique to each individual. They are generally social animals and can be seen in small harems to large herds. In addition to their stripes, zebras have erect, mohawk-like manes. Unlike their closest relatives, horses and asses, zebras have never been truly domesticated.. There are three species of zebra: the Plains Zebra, Grévy's Zebra and the Mountain Zebra. The Plains zebra and the Mountain zebra belong to the subgenus Hippotigris, but Grevy's zebra is the sole species of subgenus Dolichohippus. The latter resembles an ass while the former two are more horse-like. Nevertheless, DNA and molecular data show that zebras do indeed have monophyletic origins. All three belong to the genus Equus along with other living equids. In certain regions of Kenya, Plains zebras and Grevy's zebras coexist.. The unique stripes and behaviors of zebras make these among the animals most familiar to people. They can be found in a variety of habitats, such as grasslands, savannas, woodlands, thorny scrublands, mountains and coastal hills. However, various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations, in particular hunting for skins and habitat destruction. Grevy's zebra and the Mountain zebra are endangered. While Plains zebras are much more plentiful, one subspecies, the quagga, went extinct in the late nineteenth century.. The name \"zebra\" comes from the Old Portuguese word zevra which means \"wild ass\". The pronunciation is     internationally, or     in North America.. Zebras were the second lineage to diverge from the earliest proto-horses, after the asses, around 4 million years ago. Grevy's zebra is believed to have been the first zebra species to emerge. The ancestors of the Equus horses are believed to have been striped, and zebras must have retained the stripes of their ancestors due to their advantage for social animals in tropical environments. Extensive stripes would be of little use to equids that live in low densities in deserts (like asses and some horses) or ones that live in colder climates with shaggy coats and annual shading (like some horses).   Fossils of an ancient equid were discovered in the Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument in Hagerman, Idaho. It was named the Hagerman horse with a scientific name of Equus simplicidens. It is believed to have been similar to the Grevy's zebra.   The animals had stocky zebra-like bodies and short, narrow, donkey-like skulls.    Grevy's zebra also has a donkey-like skull. The Hagerman horse is also called the American zebra or Hagerman zebra.. Zebras in Botswana. There are three extant species. Collectively, two of the species have 8 subspecies (7 extant). Zebra populations are diverse, and the relationships between and the taxonomic status of several of the subspecies are not well known.. * Genus: Equus. ** Subgenus: Hippotigris. *** Plains Zebra, Equus quagga. **** Quagga, Equus quagga quagga (extinct). **** Burchell's Zebra, Equus quagga burchellii (includes Damara Zebra). **** Grant's Zebra, Equus quagga boehmi. **** Selous' Zebra, Equus quagga borensis. **** Chapman's Zebra, Equus quagga chapmani. **** Crawshay's Zebra, Equus quagga crawshayi. *** Mountain Zebra, Equus zebra. **** Cape Mountain Zebra, Equus zebra zebra. **** Hartmann's Mountain Zebra, Equus zebra hartmannae. ** Subgenus: Dolichohippus. *** Grévy's Zebra, Equus grevyi.

This is accomplished in several ways. First, the vertical striping helps the zebra hide in grass. While seeming absurd at first glance considering that grass is neither white nor black, it is supposed to be effective against the zebra's main predator, the lion, which is color blind. Theoretically a zebra standing still in tall grass may not be noticed at all by a lion. Additionally, since zebras are herd animals, the stripes may help to confuse predators - a number of zebras standing or moving close together may appear as one large animal, making it more difficult for the lion to pick out any single zebra to attack.    A herd of zebras scattering to avoid a predator will also represent to that predator a confused mass of vertical stripes travelling in multiple directions making it difficult for the predator to track an individual visually as it separates from its herdmates, although biologists have never observed lions appearing confused by zebra stripes.. A more recent theory, supported by experiment, posits that the disruptive colouration is also an effective means of confusing the visual system of the blood-sucking tsetse fly. Waage, J. K. (1981). How the zebra got its stripes: biting flies as selective agents in the evolution of zebra colouration. J. Entom. Soc. South Africa. 44: 351 - 358.  Alternative theories include that the stripes coincide with fat patterning beneath the skin, serving as a thermoregulatory mechanism for the zebra, and that wounds sustained disrupt the striping pattern to clearly indicate the fitness of the animal to potential mates.. A zebra walking. Like horses, zebras walk, trot, canter and gallop. They are generally slower than horses but their great stamina helps them outpace predators. When chased, a zebra will zig-zag from side to side making it more difficult for the predator. When cornered the zebra will rear up and kick or bite its attacker.. Closeup of a zebra. Zebras have excellent eyesight. It is believed that they can see in color. Like most ungulates the zebra has its eyes on the sides of its head, giving it a wide field of view. Zebras also have night vision, although not as advanced as that of most of their predators, but their hearing compensates.. Zebras have great hearing, and tend to have larger, rounder ears than horses. Like horses and other ungulates, zebra can turn their ears in almost any direction. In addition to eyesight and hearing, zebras have an acute sense of smell and taste.. Zebras in Tanzania. Like most members of the horse family, zebras are highly sociable. Their social structure, however, depends on the species. Mountain zebras and Plains zebras live in groups, known as 'harems', consisting of one stallion with up to six mares and their foals. Bachelor males either live alone or with groups of other bachelors until they are old enough to challenge a breeding stallion. When attacked by packs of hyenas or wild dogs, a zebra group will huddle together with the foals in the middle while the stallion tries to ward them off.. Unlike the other zebra species, Grevy's zebras do not have permanent social bonds. A group of these zebras rarely stays together for more than a few months. The foals stay with their mother, while the adult male lives alone. However like the other two zebra species, bachelor male zebras will organize in groups.. Like horses, zebras sleep standing up and only sleep when neighbors are around to warn them of predators.. A zebra feeding on grass. Zebras communicate with each other with high pitched barks and whinnying. Grevy's zebras make mule-like brays. A zebra’s ears signify its mood. When a zebra is in a calm, tense or friendly mood, its ears stand erect. When it is frightened, its ears are pushed forward. When angry, the ears are pulled backward. When surveying an area for predators, zebras will stand in an alert posture; with ears erect, head held high, and staring. When tense they will also snort. When a predator is spotted or sensed, a zebra will bark (or bray) loudly.. Mother and foal at the Dallas Zoo. Zebras are very adaptable grazers. They feed mainly on grasses but will also eat shrubs, herbs, twigs, leaves and bark. Their well adapted digestive system allows them to subsist on diets of lower nutritional quality than that necessary for herbivores.. Like most animal species, female zebras mature earlier than the males and a mare may have her first foal by the age of three. Males are not able to breed until the age of five or six. Mares may give birth to one foal every twelve months. She nurses the foal for up to a year. Like horses, zebras are able to stand, walk and suckle shortly after they're born. A zebra foal is brown and white instead of black and white at birth.. Plains and Mountain zebra foals are protected by their mother as well as the head stallion and the other mares in their group. Grevy’s zebra foals have only their mother as a regular protector since, as noted above, Grevy's zebra groups often disband after a few months.. Lord Rothschild with his famed zebra carriage (Equus burchelli), which he frequently drove through London. Attempts have been made to train zebras for riding since they have better resistance than horses to African diseases. However most of these attempts failed, due to the zebra's more unpredictable nature and tendency to panic under stress. For this reason, zebra-mules or zebroids (crosses between any species of zebra and a horse, pony, donkey or ass) are preferred over pure-bred zebras.. In England, the zoological collector Lord Rothschild frequently used zebras to draw a carriage. In 1907, Rosendo Ribeiro, the first doctor in Nairobi, Kenya, used a riding zebra for house-calls. In the mid 1800s Governor George Grey imported zebras to New Zealand from his previous posting in South Africa, and used them to pull his carriage on his privately owned Kawau Island.. A tamed zebra being ridden in East Africa. Captain Horace Hayes, in \"Points of the Horse\" (circa 1893) compared the usefulness of different zebra species. In 1891, Hayes broke a mature, intact Mountain Zebra stallion to ride in two days time, and the animal was quiet enough for his wife to ride and be photographed upon. He found the Burchell's zebra easy to break in and considered it ideal for domestication, as it was immune to the bite of the tsetse fly. He considered the quagga well-suited to domestication due to being easy to train to saddle and harness. Hayes, Capt. Horace (1893),  Points of the Horse, pp. 311-316, London: W. Thacker. Modern man has had great impact on the zebra population. Zebras were, and still are, hunted mainly for their skins. The Cape mountain zebra was hunted to near extinction with less than 100 individuals by the 1930s. However the population has increased to about 700 due to conservation efforts. Both Mountain zebra subspecies are currently protected in national parks but are still endangered.. Zebras on the Botswana coat of arms. The Grevy's zebra is also endangered. Hunting and competition from livestock have greatly decreased their population. Because of the population's small size, environmental hazards, such as drought, are capable of easily affecting the entire species. Plains zebras are much more numerous and have a healthy population. Nevertheless they too are threatened by hunting and habitat change from farming. One subspecies, the quagga, is now extinct.. Zebras have been the subject of African folk tales which tell how they got their stripes. According to a Bushmen folk tale of Namibia, the zebra was once all white but got its black stripes after a fight with a baboon over a waterhole. After kicking the baboon so hard the zebra lost his balance and tripped over a fire and the fire sticks left scorches mark all over this white coat.    In the film Fantasia, two centaurs are depicted being half human and half zebra, instead of the typical half human and half horse.. Illustration of a zebra by Ludolphus. Zebra are a popular subject in art.    The fourth Mughal emperor Jahangir (r.1605-24), commissioned a painting of the zebra, which was completed by Ustad Mansur. Cohen, M.J.

When in movies and cartoons zebras are most often miscellaneous characters but have had some starring roles, notably in Madagascar and Racing Stripes. Zebras are also serve as mascots and symbols for products and corporations, notably Zebra Technologies and Fruit Stripe gum.

The  lyre is a stringed musical instrument well known for its use in classical antiquity and later. The recitations of the Ancient Greeks were accompanied by lyre playing. The lyre of Classical Antiquity was ordinarily played by being strummed with a plectrum, like a guitar or a zither, rather than being plucked, like a harp. The fingers of the free hand silenced the unwanted strings in the chord.. Lyres from various times and places are regarded by some organologists (specialists in the history of musical instruments) as a branch of the zither family, a general category which includes many different stringed instruments, such as lutes, guitars, kantele, and psalteries, not just zithers.. Others view the lyre and zither as being two separate classes. Those specialists maintain that the zither is distinguished by strings spread across all or most of its soundboard, or the top surface of its sound chest, also called soundbox or resonator, as opposed to the lyre, whose strings emanate from a more or less common point off the soundboard, such as a tailpiece. Examples of that difference include a piano (a keyed zither) and a violin (referred to by some as a species of fingerboard lyre). Some specialists even argue that instruments such as the violin and guitar belong to a class apart from the lyre because they have no yokes or uprights surmounting their resonators as \\\"true\\\" lyres have. This group they usually refer to as the lute class, after the instrument of that name, and include within it the guitar, the violin, the banjo, and similar stringed instruments with fingerboards. Those who differ with that opinion counter by calling the lute, violin, guitar, banjo, and other such instruments \\\"independent fingerboard lyres,\\\" as opposed to simply \\\"fingerboard lyres\\\" such as the Welsh crwth, which have both fingerboards and frameworks above their resonators.. One point on which organologists universally agree is that the distinction between harps on the one hand and zithers and lyres (and, in some views, lutes) on the other is that harps have strings emanating directly from the soundboard and residing in a plane that is basically perpendicular to the soundboard, as opposed to the other instruments, whose strings are attached to one or more points somewhere off the soundboard (e.g., wrest pins on a zither, tailpiece on a lyre or lute) and lie in a plane essentially parallel to it. They also agree that neither the overall size of the instrument nor the number of strings on it have anything to do with its classification. For example, small Scottish and Irish harps can be held on the lap, while some ancient Sumerian lyres appear to have been as tall as a seated man (see Kinsky; also Sachs, History ..., under \\\"References\\\"). Regarding the number of strings, the standard 88-key piano has many more strings than even the largest harp.. Women posing as a Siren with a lyre in 1913.. A classical lyre has a hollow body or sound-chest (also known as soundbox or resonator). Extending from this sound-chest are two raised arms, which are sometimes hollow, and are curved both outward and forward. They are connected near the top by a crossbar or yoke. An additional crossbar, fixed to the sound-chest, forms the bridge which transmits the vibrations of the strings. The deepest note was that farthest from the player's body; as the strings did not differ much in length, more weight may have been gained for the deeper notes by thicker strings, as in the violin and similar modern instruments, or they were tuned by having a  slacker tension. The strings were of gut. They were stretched between the yoke and bridge, or to a tailpiece below the bridge. There were two ways of tuning: one was to fasten the strings to pegs which might be turned; the other was to change the place of the string upon the crossbar; probably both expedients were used simultaneously.. Statue of the  Olympian deity, Apollo holding a lyre.. According to ancient Greek mythology, the young god Hermes created the lyre from a slaughtered cow from Apollo's sacred herd, using the intestines for the strings. Lyres were associated with Apollonian virtues of moderation and equilibrium, contrasting with the Dionysian pipes and aulos, both of which represented ecstasy and celebration.. Locales in southern Europe, western Asia, or north Africa have been proposed as the historic birthplace of the genus. The instrument is still played in north-eastern parts of Africa.. Some of the cultures using and developing the lyre were the Aeolian and Ionian Greek colonies on the coasts of Asia (ancient Asia Minor, modern day Turkey) bordering the Lydian empire. Some mythic masters like Orpheus, Musaeus, and Thamyris were believed to have been born in Thrace, another place of extensive Greek colonization.. The name kissar (kithara) given by the ancient Greeks to Egyptian box instruments reveals the apparent similarities recognized by Greeks themselves. The cultural peak of ancient Egypt, and thus the possible age of the earliest instruments of this type, predates the 5th century classic Greece.. This indicates the possibility that the lyre might have existed in one of Greece's neighboring countries, either Thrace, Lydia, or Egypt, and was introduced into Greece at pre-classic times.. The number of strings on the classical lyre varied at different epochs, and possibly in different localities \\u2013 four, seven and ten having been favorite numbers. They were used without a fingerboard, no Greek description or representation having ever been met with that can be construed as referring to one. Nor was a bow possible, the flat sound-board being an insuperable impediment. The plectrum, however, was in constant use. It was held in the right hand to set the upper strings in vibration; when not in use, it hung from the instrument by a ribbon. The fingers of the left hand touched the lower strings (presumably to silence those whose notes were not wanted).. There is no evidence as to the stringing of the Greek lyre in the heroic age. Plutarch says that Olympus and Terpander used but three strings to accompany their recitation. As the four strings led to seven and eight by doubling the tetrachord, so the trichord is connected with the hexachord or six-stringed lyre depicted on so many archaic Greek vases. The accuracy of this representation cannot be insisted upon, the vase painters being little mindful of the complete expression of details; yet one may suppose their tendency would be rather to imitate than to invent a number. It was their constant practice to represent the strings as being damped by the fingers of the left hand of the player, after having been struck by the plectrum which he held in the right hand. Before Greek civilization had assumed its historic form, there was likely to have been great freedom and independence of different localities in the matter of lyre stringing, which is corroborated by the antique use of the chromatic (half-tone) and enharmonic (quarter-tone) tunings pointing to an early exuberance, and perhaps also to an Asiatic bias towards refinements of intonation.. While the lyre is no longer played in modern Greece, the term lyra lives on as the name shared by various regional types of fiddles (bowed lutes) found throughout the country. There are two basic styles of lyra fiddles: 1) a pear-shaped instrument with a vaulted back which is found in the Greek islands \\u2013 in particular, the Dodecanese and Crete \\u2013 and the northern mainland regions of Macedonia and Thrace; and 2) an instrument with a narrow rectangular cylinder body of the Pontic  Greeks who trace their roots to Pontos (Pontus), the Black Sea region of northern Turkey. (The Pontic Greek lyra is also known as kemenche.) Both types of lyra typically have three strings. They are held vertically upright and bowed horizontally; if the player is seated, the instrument's base rests on the player's upper left thigh. The Cretan lyra is traditionally played in a duo with the laouto, a long-neck fretted lute that is strummed like a guitar.. Reproduction of the lyre from the royal burial at Sutton Hoo, late 6th/early 7th century AD. Other instruments known as lyres have been fashioned and used in Europe outside the Greco-Roman world since at least the early Middle Ages, and one view holds that many modern stringed instruments are late-emerging examples of the lyre class. There is no clear evidence that non-Greco-Roman lyres were played exclusively with plectra, and numerous instruments regarded by some as modern lyres are played with bows.. Lyres appearing to have emerged independently of Greco-Roman prototypes were used by the Teutonic, Gallic, Scandinavian, and Celtic peoples over a thousand years ago. Dates of origin, which probably vary from region to region, cannot be determined, but the oldest known fragments of such instruments are thought to date from around the sixth century of the Common Era. After the bow made its way into Europe from the Middle-East, around two centuries later, it was applied to several species of those lyres that were small enough to make bowing practical. There came to be two broad classes of bowed European yoke lyres: those with fingerboards dividing the open space within the yoke longitudinally, and those without fingerboards. The last surviving examples of instruments within the latter class were the Scandinavian talharpa and jouhikko. Different tones could be obtained from a single bowed string by pressing the fingernails of the player's left hand against various points along the string to fret the string.. The last of the bowed yoke lyres with fingerboard was the \\\"modern\\\" (ca. 1485 - ca. 1800) Welsh crwth. It had several predecessors both in the British Isles and in Continental Europe. Pitch was changed on individual strings by pressing the string firmly against the fingerboard with the fingertips. Like a violin, this method shortened the vibrating length of the string to produce higher tones, while releasing the finger gave the string a greater vibrating length, thereby producing a tone lower in pitch. This is the principle on which the modern violin and guitar work.. While the dates of origin and other evolutionary details of the European bowed yoke lyres continue to be disputed among organologists, there is general agreement that none of them were the ancestors of modern orchestral bowed stringed instruments, as once was thought.. In furniture design, a lyre arm is a wooden lyre-shaped element often used at the front of the arm of a chair, typically created as an exposed wooden part of a chair, sofa or other furniture piece.. A music holder used by marching bands is also called a \\\"lyre\\\" for its shape similar to this instrument.. Lyre also can denote the framework supporting the foot pedals underneath a piano. The term is most often used in connection with older pianos of ornate designs..

Located on the northwest coast of Java, it has an area of   and a population of 8,490,000.  Jakarta is the country's economic, cultural and political center. It is the most populous city in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, and is the twelfth-largest city in the world. The metropolitan area, Jabodetabek, is the second largest in the world. Jakarta is listed as a global city in the 2008 Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network (GaWC) research.    the city's name is derived from the Sanskrit word \\\"Jayakarta\\\" (\\u091c\\u092f\\u0915\\u0930\\u094d) which translates as \\\"victorious deed,\\\" \\\"complete act,\\\"or \\\"complete victory.\\\". Established in the fourth century, the city became an important trading port for the Kingdom of Sunda. It grew as the capital of the colonial Dutch East Indies. It was made capital of Indonesia when the country became independent after World War II. It was formerly known as Sunda Kelapa (397\\u20131527), Jayakarta (1527\\u20131619), Batavia (1619\\u20131942), and Djakarta (1942\\u20131972).. Landmarks include the National Monument and Istiqlal Mosque. The city is the seat of the ASEAN Secretariat. Jakarta is served by the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport, and Tanjung Priok harbour; it is connected by several intercity and commuter railways, and served by several bus lines running on reserved busways.. The former Stadhuis of Batavia, the seat of Governor General of VOC. The building now serves as Jakarta History Museum, Jakarta Old Town area.. Dutch Batavia in the 17th Century, built in what is now North Jakarta. The Jakarta area was part of the fourth century Indianized kingdom of Tarumanagara. In AD 39, King Purnawarman established Sunda Pura as a new capital city for the kingdom, located at the northern coast of Java.    Purnawarman left seven memorial stones across the area with inscriptions bearing his name, including the present-day Banten and West Java provinces.    After the power of Tarumanagara declined, its territories, including Sunda Pura, became part of the Kingdom of Sunda. The harbour area was renamed Sunda Kalapa as written in a Hindu monk's lontar manuscripts.  Bujangga Manik Manuscript which are now located at the Bodleian Library of Oxford University in England, and travel records by Prince Bujangga Manik.( )  By the fourteenth century, Sunda Kelapa became a major trading port for the kingdom. The first European fleet, four Portuguese ships from Malacca, arrived in 1513 when the Portuguese were looking for a route for spices, especially black pepper.. The Kingdom of Sunda made a peace agreement with Portugal by allowing the Portuguese to build a port in 1522 in order to defend against the rising power of the Sultanate of Demak from central Java.   . In 1527, Fatahillah, a Sumatran Malay warrior from Demak attacked Kingdom of Sunda and succeeded in conquering the harbour on June 22, 1527, after which Sunda Kelapa was renamed Jayakarta.. The Castle of Batavia, seen from West Kali Besar by Andries Beeckman circa 1656-58. Through the relationship with Prince Jayawikarta from the Sultanate of Banten, Dutch ships arrived in Jayakarta in 1596. In 1602, the British East India Company's first voyage, commanded by Sir James Lancaster, arrived in Aceh and sailed on to Banten where they were allowed to build a trading post. This site became the center of British trade in Indonesia until 1682.. Jayawikarta is thought to have made trading connections with the English merchants, rivals of the Dutch, by allowing them to build houses directly across from the Dutch buildings in 1615.    When relations between Prince Jayawikarta and the Dutch deteriorated, Jayawikarta's soldiers attacked the Dutch fortress. Prince Jayakarta's army and the British were defeated by the Dutch, in part owing to the timely arrival of Jan Pieterszoon Coen (J.P. Coen). The Dutch burned the English fort, and forced the English to retreat on their ships. The victory consolidated Dutch power and in 1619 they renamed the city \\\"Batavia.\\\". Batavia c.1870. Commercial opportunities in the capital of the Dutch colony attracted Indonesian and especially Chinese immigrants, the increasing numbers creating burdens on the city. Tensions grew as the colonial government tried to restrict Chinese migration through deportations. On 9 October 1740, 5,000 Chinese were massacred and the following year, Chinese inhabitants were moved to Glodok outside the city walls.    The city began to move further south as epidemics in 1835 and 1870 encouraged more people to move far south of the port. The Koningsplein, now Merdeka Square was completed in 1818, the housing park of Menteng was started in 1913,   and Kebayoran Baru was the last Dutch-built residential area.  By 1930 Batavia had more than 500,000 inhabitants,  Colonial Economy and Society, 1870-1940. Source: U.S. Library of Congress.  including 37,067 Europeans.

In 1950, once independence was secured, Jakarta was once again made the national capital.  Indonesia's founding president, Sukarno, envisaged Jakarta as a great international city. He instigated large government-funded projects undertaken with openly nationalistic and modernist architecture.       Projects in Jakarta included a clover-leaf highway, a major boulevard (Jalan MH Thamrin-Sudirman), monuments such as The National Monument, major hotels, shopping centre, and a new parliament building.. In October 1965, Jakarta was the site of an abortive coup attempt which saw 6 top generals killed, and ultimately resulted in the downfall of Sukarno and the start of Suharto's \\\"New Order.

In 1966, Jakarta was declared a \\\"special capital city district\\\" (daerah khusus ibukota), thus gaining a status approximately equivalent to that of a state or province.    Lieutenant General Ali Sadikin served as Governor from the mid-60's commencement of the \\\"New Order\\\" through to 1977; he rehabilitated roads and bridges, encouraged the arts, built several hospitals, and a large number of new schools. He also cleared out slum dwellers for new development projects some for the benefit of the Suharto family       and tried to eliminate rickshaws and ban street vendors. He began control of migration to the city in order to stem the overcrowding and poverty. .    Foreign investment contributed to a real estate boom which changed the face of the city.. The boom ended with the 1997/98 East Asian Economic crisis putting Jakarta at the center of violence, protest, and political maneuvering. Long-time president, Suharto, began to lose his grip on power. Tensions reached a peak in the Jakarta riots of May 1998, when four students were shot dead at Trisakti University by security forces; four days of riots and violence ensued that killed an estimated 1,200, and destroyed or damaged 6,000 buildings.

John Calvin Coolidge, Jr. (July 4 1872   January 5 1933), more commonly known as Calvin Coolidge, was the thirtieth President of the United States (1923\\u20131929).  A lawyer from Vermont, Coolidge worked his way up the ladder of Massachusetts state politics, eventually becoming governor of that state. His actions during the Boston Police Strike of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight. Soon after, he was elected as the twenty-ninth Vice President in 1920 and succeeded to the Presidency upon the death of Warren G. Harding. Elected in his own right in 1924, he gained a reputation as a small-government conservative.. In many ways Coolidge's style of governance was a throwback to the passive presidency of the nineteenth century. Sobel, 14  He restored public confidence in the White House after the scandals of his predecessor's administration, and left office with considerable popularity. McCoy, 420\\u2013421; Greenberg, 49\\u201353  As his biographer later put it, \\\"he embodied the spirit and hopes of the middle class, could interpret their longings and express their opinions. That he did represent the genius of the average is the most convincing proof of his strength.\\\" Fuess, 500. Many later criticized Coolidge as part of a general criticism of laissez-faire government.

Greenberg, 1\\u20137. John Calvin Coolidge Jr. was born in Plymouth, Windsor County, Vermont, on July 4 1872, the only U.S. President to be born on the fourth of July. He was the elder of two children of John Calvin Sr. and Victoria Coolidge. The Coolidge family had deep roots in New England. His earliest American ancestor, John Coolidge, emigrated from Cambridge, England, around 1630 and settled in Watertown, Massachusetts. Fuess, 12  Coolidge's great-great-grandfather, also named John Coolidge, was an American army officer in the American Revolution, and was one of the first selectmen of the town of Plymouth Notch. Fuess, 7  Most of Coolidge's ancestors were farmers. The more well-known Coolidges, such as architect Charles Allerton Coolidge, and diplomat Archibald Cary Coolidge, were descended from other branches of the family that had stayed in Massachusetts.  Coolidge's grandmother Sarah Almeda Brewer had two famous first cousins: Arthur Brown, a United States Senator, and Olympia Brown, a women's suffragist.. Coolidge as an Amherst undergraduate. Coolidge's grandfather, Calvin Coolidge, held some local government offices in Plymouth and was best remembered as a man with \\\"a fondness for practical jokes\\\". Fuess, 14  His grandmother, Sarah Brewer, was also of New England. It is through this ancestor that Coolidge claimed to be descended in part from American Indians. McCoy, 5  Coolidge's father was also a farmer, but spent some time as a schoolteacher and justice of the peace. Fuess, 16  His mother, Victoria Josephine Moor Coolidge, was the daughter of another Plymouth Notch farmer.

At Amherst, Coolidge became a member of the Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta and joined the College Republicans in 1892. White, 35  While there, Coolidge met Dwight Morrow, who would become a life-long friend. Sobel, 36  Coolidge would later credit Charles E. Garman, a professor of philosophy and ethics, with having a significant influence on his education. Autobiography, 63\\u201370  He graduated cum laude in 1895. Sobel, 41  At graduation, Coolidge was selected by his classmates to compose and read the Grove Oration, a humorous speech traditionally given during the graduation ceremony.. After graduating from Amherst, at his father's urging, Coolidge moved to Northampton, Massachusetts to take up the practice of law. Avoiding the costly alternative of attending a law school, Coolidge followed the more common practice at the time of apprenticing with a local firm, Hammond & Field. John C. Hammond and Henry P. Field, both Amherst graduates themselves, introduced Coolidge to the law practice in the county seat of Hampshire County. In 1897, Coolidge was admitted to the bar. With his savings and a small inheritance from his grandfather, Coolidge was able to open his own law office in Northampton in 1898, where he practiced transactional law, believing that he served his clients best by staying out of court. As his reputation as a hard-working and diligent attorney grew, local banks and other businesses began to retain his services. Fuess, 74\\u201381; McCoy 22\\u201326. In 1905 Coolidge met and married Grace Anna Goodhue, a local schoolteacher and fellow Vermonter. They were opposites in personality: she was talkative and fun-loving, while Coolidge was quiet and serious. Greenberg, 58\\u201359  Not long after their marriage, Coolidge handed her a bag with fifty-two pairs of socks in it, all of them full of holes. Grace's reply was \\\"Did you marry me to darn your socks?\\\" Without cracking a smile and with his usual seriousness, Calvin answered, \\\"No, but I find it mighty handy.\\\" Telleen, Maurice.

Some biographers disagree with this rosy portrait, see Ferrell, 21\\u201323  As Coolidge wrote in his Autobiography, \\\"We thought we were made for each other. For almost a quarter of a century she has borne with my infirmities, and I have rejoiced in her graces.\\\" Autobiography, 93. The Republican Party was dominant in New England in Coolidge's time, and he followed Hammond's and Field's example by becoming active in local politics. Sobel, 49\\u201351  Coolidge campaigned locally for Republican presidential candidate William McKinley in 1896, and the next year he was selected to be a member of the Republican City Committee. Sobel, 51  In 1898, he won election to the City Council of Northampton, placing second in a ward where the top three candidates were elected.  The position offered no salary, but gave Coolidge experience in the political world. Fuess, 83  In 1899, he declined renomination, running instead for City Solicitor, a position elected by the City Council. He was elected for a one-year term in 1900, and reelected in 1901. Fuess, 84\\u201385  This position gave Coolidge more experience as a lawyer, and paid a salary of $600.  In 1902, the city council selected a Democrat for city solicitor, and Coolidge returned to an exclusively private practice. McCoy, 29  Soon thereafter, however, the clerk of courts for the county died, and Coolidge was chosen to replace him. The position paid well, but barred him from practicing law, so he only remained at the job for one year.  The next year, 1904, Coolidge met with his only defeat before the voters, losing an election to the Northampton school board. When told that some of his neighbors voted against him because he had no children in the schools he would govern, Coolidge replied \\\"Might give me time!\\\". Calvin and Grace Coolidge, about 1918.. In 1906 the local Republican committee nominated Coolidge for election to the state House of Representatives. He won a close victory over the incumbent Democrat, and reported to Boston for the 1907 session of the Massachusetts General Court. Sobel, 61  In his freshman term, Coolidge served on minor committees and, although he usually voted with the party, was known as a Progressive Republican, voting in favor of such measures as women's suffrage and the direct election of Senators. Sobel, 62; Fuess, 99  Throughout his time in Boston, Coolidge found himself allied primarily with the western Winthrop Murray Crane faction of the state Republican Party, as against the Henry Cabot Lodge-dominated eastern faction. Sobel, 63\\u201366  In 1907, he was elected to a second term. In the 1908 session, Coolidge was more outspoken, but was still not one of the leaders in the legislature. Sobel, 68\\u201369. Instead of vying for another term in the state house, Coolidge returned home to his growing family and ran for mayor of Northampton when the incumbent Democrat retired. He was well-liked in the town, and defeated his challenger by a vote of 1,597 to 1,409. Sobel, 72  During his first term (1910 to 1911), he increased teachers' salaries and retired some of the city's debt while still managing to effect a slight tax decrease. Fuess, 106\\u2013107; Sobel, 74  He was renominated in 1911, and defeated the same opponent by a slightly larger margin. Fuess, 108. Calvin Coolidge as a young legislator. In 1911 the State Senator for the Hampshire County area retired and encouraged Coolidge to run for his seat for the 1912 session. He defeated his Democratic opponent by a large margin. Sobel, 76  At the start of that term, Coolidge was selected to be chairman of a committee to arbitrate the \\\"Bread and Roses\\\" strike by the workers of the American Woolen Company in Lawrence, Massachusetts. See also the main article, Lawrence textile strike, for a full description.  After two tense months, the company agreed to the workers' demands in a settlement the committee proposed. Fuess, 110\\u2013111; McCoy, 45\\u201346  The other major issue for Republicans that year was the party split between the progressive wing, which favored Theodore Roosevelt, and the conservative wing, which favored William Howard Taft. Although he favored some progressive measures, Coolidge refused to bolt the party. Sobel, 79\\u201380; Fuess, 111  When the new Progressive Party declined to run a candidate in his state senate district, Coolidge won reelection against his Democratic opponent by an increased margin.. The 1913 session was less eventful, and Coolidge's time was mostly spent on the railroad committee, of which he was the chairman. Fuess, 111\\u2013113  Coolidge intended to retire after the 1913 session, as two terms were the norm, but when the President of the State Senate, Levi H. Greenwood, considered running for Lieutenant Governor, Coolidge decided to run again for the Senate in the hopes of being elected as its presiding officer. Fuess, 114\\u2013115  Although Greenwood later decided to run for reelection to the Senate, he was defeated and Coolidge was elected, with Crane's help, as the President of a closely divided Senate. Sobel, 80\\u201382  After his election in January 1914, Coolidge delivered a speech entitled Have Faith in Massachusetts, which was later republished as a book. Have Faith in Massachusetts: A Collection of Speeches And Messages by Calvin Coolidge, 1919, ISBN 1417926082.  His speech, later much-quoted, summarized Coolidge's philosophy of government.. Coolidge's speech was well-received and he attracted some admirers on its account. Sobel, 90\\u201392  Towards the end of the term, many of them were proposing his name for nomination to lieutenant governor. After winning reelection to the Senate by an increased margin in the 1914 elections, Coolidge was reelected unanimously to be President of the Senate. Sobel, 90; Fuess, 124  As the 1915 session drew to a close, Coolidge's supporters, led by fellow Amherst alumnus Frank Stearns, encouraged him once again to run for lieutenant governor. This time, he accepted their advice. Sobel, 92\\u201398; Fuess, 133\\u2013136. Coolidge entered the primary election for lieutenant governor and was nominated to run alongside gubernatorial candidate Samuel W. McCall. Coolidge was the leading vote-getter in the Republican primary, and balanced the Republican ticket by adding a western presence to McCall's eastern base of support. Fuess, 139\\u2013142  McCall and Coolidge won the 1915 election, with Coolidge defeating his opponent by more than 50,000 votes. Fuess, 145. Coolidge's duties as lieutenant governor were few; in Massachusetts, the lieutenant governor does not preside over the state Senate, although Coolidge did become an ex officio member of the governor's cabinet. Fuess, 150; Sobel, 104  As a full-time elected official, Coolidge no longer practiced law after 1916, though his family continued to live in Northampton. Fuess, 151\\u2013152  McCall and Coolidge were both reelected in 1916 and again in 1917 (both offices were one-year terms in those days). When McCall decided that he would not stand for a fourth term, Coolidge announced his own intention to run for governor. Sobel, 107\\u2013110. Coolidge was unopposed for the Republican nomination for Governor of Massachusetts in 1918. He and his running mate, Channing Cox, a Boston lawyer and Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, ran on the previous administration's record: fiscal conservatism, a vague opposition to Prohibition, support for women's suffrage, and support for American involvement in the First World War. Sobel, 111; McCall, 75\\u201376  The issue of the war proved divisive, especially among Irish- and German-Americans. Sobel, 112  Coolidge was elected by a margin of 16,773 votes over his opponent, Richard H. Long, in the smallest margin of victory of any of his state-wide campaigns. Sobel, 115; McCall, 76. In 1919 in response to rumors that policemen of the Boston Police Department planned to form a trade union, Police Commissioner Edwin U. Curtis issued a statement saying that such a move would not be countenanced. In August of that year, the American Federation of Labor issued a charter to the Boston Police Union. Russell, 77\\u201379; Sobel, 129  Curtis said the union's leaders were insubordinate and planned to relieve them of duty, but said that he would suspend the sentence if the union was dissolved by September 4. Russell, 86\\u201387  The mayor of Boston, Andrew Peters, convinced Curtis to delay his action for a few days, but Curtis ultimately suspended the union leaders after a brief delay, on September 8. Russell, 111\\u2013113; Sobel, 133\\u2013136. The following day about three-quarters of the policemen in Boston went on strike. The exact total was 1,117 out of 1,544. Russell, 113  Coolidge had observed the situation throughout the conflict, but had not yet intervened. That night and the next, there was sporadic violence and rioting in the lawless city. Russell, 131\\u2013170  Peters, concerned about sympathy strikes, had called up some units of the Massachusetts National Guard stationed in the Boston area and relieved Curtis of duty. Russell, 120  Coolidge, furious that the mayor had called out state guard units, finally acted. Sobel, 141  He called up more units of the National Guard, restored Curtis to office, and took personal control of the police force. Sobel, 142  Curtis proclaimed that none of the strikers would be allowed back to their former jobs, and Coolidge issued calls for a new police force to be recruited. Russell, 182\\u2013183. Samuel Gompers.. That night Coolidge received a telegram from AFL leader Samuel Gompers. \\\"Whatever disorder has occurred\\\", Gompers wrote, \\\"is due to Curtis's order in which the right of the policemen has been denied \\u2026\\\" Sobel, 143  Coolidge publicly answered Gompers's telegram with the response that would launch him into the national consciousness (quoted, above left).  Newspapers across the nation picked up on Coolidge's statement and he became the newest hero to defenders of American capitalism. In the midst of the First Red Scare, many Americans were terrified of the spread of communist revolution, like those that had taken place in Russia, Hungary, and Germany. While Coolidge had lost some friends among organized labor, conservatives across the nation had seen a rising star.. Coolidge and Cox were renominated for their respective offices in 1919. By this time Coolidge's supporters (especially Stearns) had publicized his actions in the Police Strike around the state and the nation and some of Coolidge's speeches were reissued as a book.  He was faced with the same opponent as in 1918, Richard Long, but this time Coolidge defeated him by 125,101 votes, more than ten times his margin of victory from a year earlier. The tally was Coolidge 317,774, Long 192,673. Fuess, 238.  His actions in the police strike, combined with the massive electoral victory, led to suggestions that Coolidge should run for President in 1920. Fuess, 239\\u2013243; McCoy, 102\\u2013113. By the time Coolidge was inaugurated on January 1 1919 the First World War had ended, and Coolidge pushed the legislature to give a $100 bonus to Massachusetts veterans. He also signed a bill reducing the work week for women and children from fifty-four hours to forty-eight, saying \\\"we must humanize the industry, or the system will break down.\\\" Sobel, 117; Fuess, 195  He signed into law a budget that kept the tax rates the same, while trimming four million dollars from expenditures, thus allowing the state to retire some of its debt. Fuess, 186. Coolidge also wielded the veto pen as governor. His most publicized veto was of a bill that would have increased legislators' pay by 50%. Fuess, 187; McCall, 81  In May 1920, he vetoed a bill that would have allowed the sale of beer or wine of 2.75% alcohol or less, in contravention of the Eighteenth Amendment. Although Coolidge himself was opposed to Prohibition, he felt constrained to veto the bill. \\\"Opinions and instructions do not outmatch the Constitution,\\\" he said in his veto message, \\\"Against it, they are void.\\\" Fuess, 187\\u2013188. At the 1920 Republican Convention most of the delegates were selected by state party conventions, not primaries. As such, the field was divided among many local favorites. Sobel, 152\\u2013153  Coolidge was one such candidate, and while he placed as high as sixth in the voting, the powerful party bosses never considered him a serious candidate. After ten ballots, the delegates settled on Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio as their nominee for President. Fuess, 259\\u2013260  When the time came to select a Vice Presidential nominee, the party bosses had also made a decision on who they would nominate: Senator Irvine Lenroot of Wisconsin. Fuess, 261  A delegate from Oregon, Wallace McCamant, having read Have Faith in Massachusetts, proposed Coolidge for Vice President instead.  The suggestion caught on quickly, and Coolidge found himself unexpectedly nominated. Fuess, 262\\u2013264. President Harding and Vice President Coolidge and their wives.. The Democrats nominated another Ohioan, James M. Cox, for President and the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, for Vice President. The question of the United States joining the League of Nations was a major issue in the campaign, as was the unfinished legacy of Progressivism. Sobel, 204\\u2013212  Harding ran a \\\"front-porch\\\" campaign from his home in Marion, Ohio, but Coolidge took to the campaign trail in the Upper South, New York, and New England. Sobel, 204\\u2013207  On November 2 1920, Harding and Coolidge were victorious in a landslide, winning every state outside the South.  ;    They also won in Tennessee, the first time a Republican ticket had won a Southern state since Reconstruction.. The Vice Presidency did not carry many official duties, but Coolidge was invited by President Harding to attend cabinet meetings, making him the first Vice President to do so. Sobel, 210\\u2013211  He gave speeches around the country, but none were especially noteworthy. Sobel, 219; McCoy, 136. As Vice President, Coolidge and his vivacious wife Grace were invited to quite a few parties, where the legend of \\\"Silent Cal\\\" was born. It was from this time most of the jokes and anecdotes at his expense originate. Although Coolidge was known to be a skilled and effective public speaker, in private he was a man of few words and was therefore commonly referred to as \\\"Silent Cal.\\\" A possibly apocryphal story has it that Dorothy Parker, seated next to him at a dinner, said to him, \\\"Mr. Coolidge, I've made a bet against a fellow who said it was impossible to get more than two words out of you.\\\" His famous reply: \\\"You lose.\\\" Hannaford, 169  It was also Parker who, upon learning that Coolidge had died, reportedly remarked, \\\"How can they tell?\\\" Greenberg, 9  Coolidge often seemed uncomfortable among fashionable Washington society; when asked why he continued to attend so many of their dinner parties, he replied \\\"Got to eat somewhere.\\\" Sobel, 217. As President, Coolidge's reputation as a quiet man continued. \\\"The words of a President have an enormous weight,\\\" he would later write, \\\"and ought not to be used indiscriminately.\\\" Sobel, 243  Coolidge was aware of his stiff reputation; indeed, he cultivated it. \\\"I think the American people want a solemn ass as a President,\\\" he once told Ethel Barrymore, \\\"and I think I will go along with them.\\\" Greenberg, 60. Coolidge's father, John Calvin Coolidge, Sr.. On August 2 1923, President Harding died while on a speaking tour in California. See the main article, Warren Harding#Death in office for a full description  Vice President Coolidge was visiting his family home, which did not have electricity or a telephone, in Vermont when he received word of Harding's death. Fuess, 308\\u2013309  Coolidge dressed, said a prayer, and came downstairs to greet the reporters who had assembled.  His father, a notary public, administered the oath of office in the family's parlor by the light of a kerosene lamp at 2:47 a.m. on August 3, 1923; Coolidge was re-sworn by Justice A. A. Hoehling of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia upon his return to Washington. Fuess, 310\\u2013315. Coolidge signing the Immigration Act and some appropriation bills. General John J. Pershing looks on.. The nation did not know what to make of its new President; Coolidge had not stood out in the Harding administration and many had expected him to be replaced on the ballot in 1924. Sobel, 226\\u2013228; Fuess, 303\\u2013305; Ferrell, 43\\u201351  He chose C. Bascom Slemp, a Virginia Congressman and experienced federal politician, as his secretary (a position equivalent to the modern White House Chief of Staff). Fuess, 320\\u2013322  Although many of Harding's cabinet appointees were scandal-tarred, Coolidge announced that he would not demand any of their resignations, believing that since the people had elected Harding, he should carry on Harding's presidency, at least until the next election.. He addressed Congress when it reconvened on December 6 1923, giving a speech that echoed many of Harding's themes, including immigration restriction and the need for the government to arbitrate the coal strikes then ongoing in Pennsylvania. Fuess, 328\\u2013329; Sobel, 248\\u2013249  The Washington Naval Treaty was proclaimed just one month into Coolidge's term, and was generally well received in the country.  In May 1924, the World War I veterans' Bonus Bill was passed over his veto. Fuess, 341  Coolidge signed the Immigration Act later that year, though he appended a signing statement expressing his unhappiness with the bill's specific exclusion of Japanese immigrants. Fuess, 342; Sobel, 269  Just before the Republican Convention began, Coolidge signed into law the Revenue Act of 1924, which decreased personal income tax rates while increasing the estate tax, and creating a gift tax to reinforce the transfer tax system. Sobel, 278\\u2013279. Electoral votes by state, 1924.. The Republican Convention was held from June 10 to June 12 1924 in Cleveland, Ohio; President Coolidge was nominated on the first ballot. Fuess, 345  The convention nominated Frank Lowden of Illinois for Vice President on the second ballot, but he declined via telegram. Fuess, 346  Former Brigadier General Charles G. Dawes, who would win the Nobel Peace Prize in 1925, was nominated on the third ballot; he accepted.. John W. DavisThe Democrats held their convention a month later in New York City. The convention soon deadlocked, and after 103 ballots, the delegates finally agreed on a compromise candidate, John W. Davis. Charles W. Bryan was nominated for Vice President. The Democrats' hopes were buoyed when Robert M. La Follette, Sr., a Republican Senator from Wisconsin, split from the party to form a new Progressive Party. Many believed that the split in the Republican party, like the one in 1912, would allow a Democrat to win the Presidency. Sobel, 300. Shortly after the conventions Coolidge experienced a personal tragedy. Coolidge's younger son, Calvin, Jr., developed a blister from playing tennis on the White House courts. The blister became infected, and Calvin, Jr. died. After that Coolidge became even more withdrawn. He later said that \\\"when he died, the power and glory of the Presidency went with him.\\\" Autobiography, 190  In spite of his sadness, Coolidge ran his conventional campaign; he never maligned his opponents (or even mentioned them by name) and delivered speeches on his theory of government, including several that were broadcast over radio. Sobel, 300\\u2013301  It was easily the most subdued campaign since 1896, partly because the President was grieving for his son, but partly because Coolidge's style was naturally non-confrontational. Sobel, 302\\u2013303  The other candidates campaigned in a more modern fashion, but despite the split in the Republican party, the results were very similar to those of 1920. Coolidge and Dawes won every state outside the South except for Wisconsin, La Follette's home state. Coolidge had a popular vote majority of 2.5 million over his opponents' combined total.  ,. Coolidge, reporters, and cameramen. During Coolidge's presidency the United States experienced the period of rapid economic growth known as the \\\"Roaring Twenties.\\\" His economic policy has often been misquoted as \\\"generally speaking, the business of the American people is business\\\" (full quotation below, at left). Although some commentators have criticized Coolidge as a doctrinaire laissez-faire ideologue, historian Robert Sobel offers some context based on Coolidge's sense of federalism: \\\"As Governor of Massachusetts, Coolidge supported wages and hours legislation, opposed child labor, imposed economic controls during World War I, favored safety measures in factories, and even worker representation on corporate boards. Did he support these measures while president? No, because in the 1920s, such matters were considered the responsibilities of state and local governments.\\\" Sobel, Robert.  Coolidge and American Business. John F. Kennedy Library and Museum. Retrieved from March 08, 2006 version in Internet Archive on May 18, 2007. See also Greenberg, 47.. Coolidge with his Vice President, Charles G. Dawes.. Coolidge's taxation policy, and that of his Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew Mellon, was that taxes should be lower and that fewer people should have to pay them. Sobel, 310\\u2013311; Greenberg, 127\\u2013129  The Congress concurred, and the tax burden on Americans was reduced in Coolidge's term.  In addition to these tax cuts, Coolidge proposed reductions in federal expenditures and retiring some of the federal debt. Sobel, 310\\u2013311; Fuess, 382\\u2013383  To that end, Coolidge declined to sign some of the spending that Congress approved. He vetoed the proposed McNary-Haugen Farm Relief Bill of 1926, designed to allow the federal government to purchase agricultural surpluses and sell them abroad at lowered prices. Coolidge declared that agriculture must stand \\\"on an independent business basis,\\\" and said that \\\"government control cannot be divorced from political control.\\\" Fuess, 383\\u2013384  He favored Herbert Hoover's proposal to modernize agriculture to create profits, instead of manipulating prices. When Congress re-passed the McNary-Haugen bill in 1927, Coolidge vetoed it again. Fuess, 388; Ferrell, 93  \\\"Farmers never have made much money,\\\" said Coolidge, the Vermont farmer's son, \\\"I do not believe we can do much about it.\\\" Ferrell, 86. Coolidge has often been criticized for his actions during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the worst natural disaster to hit the Gulf Coast until Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Sobel, 315; Barry, 286\\u2013287; Greenberg, 132\\u2013135  Although he did eventually name Secretary Hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief, Coolidge's lack of interest in federal flood control has been much maligned.  Coolidge did not believe that personally visiting the region after the floods would accomplish anything, but would be seen only as political grandstanding, and he did not want to incur the federal spending that flood control would require. McCoy, 330\\u2013331  Congress wanted a bill that would place the federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation; Coolidge wanted the property owners to bear much of the costs. Barry, 372\\u2013374  When Congress passed a compromise measure in 1928, Coolidge declined to take credit for it and signed the bill in private on May 15. Greenberg, 135. Coolidge's official White House portraitWhile he was not an isolationist, Coolidge was reluctant to enter foreign alliances. Sobel, 342  Coolidge saw the landslide Republican victory of 1920 as a rejection of the Wilsonian idea that the United States should join the League of Nations. McCoy, 184\\u2013185  While not completely opposed to the idea, Coolidge believed the League, as then constituted, did not serve American interests, and he did not advocate membership in it.  He spoke in favor of the United States joining the Permanent Court of International Justice, provided that the nation would not be bound by advisory decisions. McCoy, 360  The Senate eventually approved joining the Court (with reservations) in 1926. McCoy, 363  The League of Nations accepted the reservations, but suggested some modifications of their own. Greenberg, 114\\u2013116  The Senate failed to act; the United States never joined the World Court.. Coolidge's best-known initiative was the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928, named for Coolidge's Secretary of State, Frank B. Kellogg, and French foreign minister Aristide Briand. The treaty, ratified in 1929, committed signatories including the U.S., the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan to \\\"renounce war, as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another.\\\" Fuess, 421\\u2013423  The treaty did not actually achieve its result \\u2014 the outlawry of war \\u2014 but did provide the founding principle for international law after World War II. McCoy, 380\\u2013381; Greenberg, 123\\u2013124. Coolidge continued the previous administration's policy not to recognize the Soviet Union. McCoy, 181  He also continued the United States' support for the elected government of Mexico against the rebels there, lifting the arms embargo on that country. McCoy, 178\\u2013179  He sent his close friend Dwight Morrow to Mexico as the American ambassador. Sobel, 349  Coolidge represented the U.S. at the Pan American Conference in Havana, Cuba, making him the only sitting U.S. President to visit the country. The United States' occupation of Nicaragua and Haiti continued under his administration, but Coolidge withdrew American troops from the Dominican Republic in 1924. Fuess, 414\\u2013417; Ferrell, 122\\u2013123. President Coolidge signed a bill granting Native Americans full U.S. citizenship. Coolidge is shown above on October 22, 1924 holding a ceremonial hat. Coolidge did not seek renomination; he announced his decision to reporters, in writing, with typical terseness: \\\"I do not choose to run for President in 1928.\\\" Sobel, 370  After allowing them to take that in, Coolidge elaborated. \\\"If I take another term, I will be in the White House till 1933 \\u2026 Ten years in Washington is longer than any other man has had it\\u2014too long!\\\" White, 361  In his memoirs, Coolidge explained his decision not to run: \\\"The Presidential office takes a heavy toll of those who occupy it and those who are dear to them. While we should not refuse to spend and be spent in the service of our country, it is hazardous to attempt what we feel is beyond our strength to accomplish.\\\" Autobiography, 239  After leaving office, he and Grace returned to Northampton, where he wrote his memoirs. The Republicans retained the White House in 1928 in the person of Coolidge's Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover.. Coolidge had been lukewarm on the choice of Hoover as his successor; on one occasion he remarked that \\\"for six years that man has given me unsolicited advice all of it bad.\\\" Brandes, ___  Even so, Coolidge had no desire to split the party by publicly opposing the popular Commerce Secretary's nomination. McCoy, 390\\u2013391; Wilson, 122\\u2013123  The delegates did consider nominating Vice President Charles Dawes to be Hoover's running mate, but the convention selected Senator Charles Curtis instead. Wilson, 125\\u2013127. Despite his reputation as a quiet and even reclusive politician, Coolidge made use of the new medium of radio and made radio history several times while President. He made himself available to reporters, giving 529 press conferences, meeting with reporters more regularly than any President before or since. Greenberg, 7  His inauguration was the first presidential inauguration broadcast on radio. On 6 December 1923, Coolidge was the first President whose address to Congress was broadcast on radio. Sobel, 252  On February 12 1924, he became the first President of the United States to deliver a political speech on radio. On August 11 1924, Coolidge was filmed on the White House lawn by Lee De Forest in DeForest's Phonofilm sound-on-film process, becoming the first President to appear in a sound film. The title of the DeForest film was President Coolidge, Taken on the White House Lawn.   Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon. Coolidge was the only president to have his face on a coin during his lifetime, the sesquicentennial commemorative half dollar of 1926.. Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone. Coolidge appointed one Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States, Harlan Fiske Stone in 1925. Stone was Coolidge's fellow Amherst alumnus and was serving as dean of Columbia Law School when Coolidge appointed him to be Attorney General in 1924. He appointed Stone to the Supreme Court in 1925, and the Senate approved the nomination. Fuess, 364  Stone was later appointed Chief Justice by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.. Coolidge addressing a crowd at Arlington National Cemetery's Roman style Memorial Amphitheater in 1924.. After the presidency, Coolidge served as chairman of the non-partisan Railroad Commission, as honorary president of the Foundation of the Blind, as a director of New York Life Insurance Company, as president of the American Antiquarian Society, and as a trustee of Amherst College.   Coolidge Family Papers, 1802\\u20131932, Vermont Historical Society Library. Retrieved on May 18, 2007  Coolidge received an honorary Doctor of Laws from Bates College in Lewiston, Maine.. Coolidge published his autobiography in 1929 and wrote a syndicated newspaper column, \\\"Calvin Coolidge Says,\\\" from 1930\\u20131931. Sobel, 403; Ferrell, 201\\u2013202  Faced with looming defeat in 1932, some Republicans spoke of rejecting Herbert Hoover as their party's nominee, and instead drafting Coolidge to run, but the former President made it clear that he was not interested in running again, and that he would publicly repudiate any effort to draft him, should it come about. Fuess, 457\\u2013459; Greenberg, 153  Hoover was renominated, and Coolidge made several radio addresses in support of him. Fuess, 460. He died suddenly of a heart attack at his home in Northampton, \\\"The Beeches,\\\" at 12:45 p.m., January 5 1933. Greenberg, 154\\u2013155  Shortly before his death, Coolidge confided to an old friend: \\\"I feel I am no longer fit in these times.\\\" Sobel, 410. Coolidge is buried beneath a simple headstone in Notch Cemetery, Plymouth Notch, Vermont, where the family homestead is maintained as a museum.

opponent of the expansion of slavery in the united states in his short autobiography written for the 1860 presidential campaign lincoln would describe his protest in the illinois legislature as one that briefly defined his position on the slavery question and so far as it goes it was then the same that it is now. this was in reference to the antiexpansion sentiments he had then expressed. doris kearns goodwin team of rivals the political genius of abraham lincoln 2005 p. 91. holzer pg. 232. writing of the cooper union speech holzer notes cooper union proved a unique confluence of political culture rhetorical opportunity technological innovation and human genius and it brought abraham lincoln to the center stage of american politics at precisely the right time and place and with precisely the right message that slavery was wrong and ought to be confined to the areas where it already existed and placed on the course of ultimate extinction... . lincoln won the republican party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year. during his term he helped preserve the united states by leading the defeat of the secessionist confederate states of america in the american civil war. he introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery issuing his emancipation proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the thirteenth amendment to the constitution in 1865.. lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort especially the selection of top generals including ulysses s. grant. historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the republican party well bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. lincoln successfully defused a war scare with the united kingdom in 1861. under his leadership the union took control of the border slave states at the start of the war. additionally he managed his own reelection in the 1864 presidential election.. opponents of the war also known as copperheads criticized him for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. conversely the radical republicans an abolitionist faction of the republican party criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. even with these problems lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches his gettysburg address is but one example of this. at the close of the war lincoln held a moderate view of reconstruction seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. his assassination in 1865 was the first presidential assassination in u.s. history and made him a martyr for the ideal of national unity.. scholars now rank lincoln among the top three u.s. presidents with the majority of those surveyed placing him first. he is noted for his lasting influence on u.s. politics including a redefinition of republicanism. as diggins explains lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself. john patrick diggins the lost soul of american politics virtue selfinterest and the foundations of liberalism 1986 p. 307. foner 1970 p. 215 noted that lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism. jaffa 2000 p. 399 stresses lincolns emphasis on the declaration of independence as what lincoln called the sheet anchor of republicanism. see also mcpherson 1992 pp.6164.. abraham lincoln was born on february 12 1809 to thomas lincoln and nancy hanks two uneducated farmers. lincoln was born in a oneroom log cabin on the sinking spring farm in southeast hardin county kentucky now part of larue county. this area was at the time considered the frontier. the name abraham was chosen to commemorate his grandfather who was killed in an american indian raid in 1786. donald 1995 p 21 his elder sister sarah lincoln was born in 1807 a younger brother thomas jr died in infancy. it is sometimes debated whether lincoln had marfan syndrome an autosomal dominant disorder of the connective tissue characterized by long limbs and great physical stature. marfan syndrome introduction aug 1 2006. symbolic log cabin at abraham lincoln birthplace national historic site.. for some time thomas lincoln was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the kentucky back country. he had purchased the sinking spring farm in december of 1808 for 200 cash and assumption of a debt. the farm site is now preserved as part of abraham lincoln birthplace national historic site. the family belonged to a baptist church that had seceded from a larger church over the issue of slavery. though lincoln was exposed to his parents antislavery sentiment from a very young age he never joined their church or any other church for that matter. as a youth he had little use for religion. life of abraham lincoln colonel ward h. lamon 1872 portions reprinted in chapter viii abraham lincoln deist and admirer of thomas paine from the book religious beliefs of our presidents by franklin steiner 1936. lincoln was just seven years old when in 1816 the family was forced to make a new start in perry county now in spencer county indiana. he later noted that this move was partly on account of slavery and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in kentucky unlike land in the northwest territory kentucky never had a proper u.s. survey and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property. lincoln was only nine when his mother then thirtyfour years old died of milk sickness. soon afterwards his father remarried to sarah bush johnston. sarah lincoln raised young lincoln like one of her own children. years later she compared lincoln to her own son saying both were good boys but i must say both now being dead that abe was the best boy i ever saw or ever expect to see. lincoln was affectionate toward his stepmother whom he would call mother for the rest of his life but he was distant from his father. donald 1995 pp. 28 152.. in 1830 after more economic and landtitle difficulties in indiana the family settled on public land ref in macon county illinois. some scholars believe that it was his fathers repeated landtitle difficulties and ensuing financial hardships that led young lincoln to study law. the following winter was desolate and especially brutal and the family considered moving back to indiana. the following year when his father relocated the family to a new homestead in coles county illinois twentytwoyearold lincoln struck out on his own canoeing down the sangamon river to the village of new salem in sangamon county. later that year hired by new salem businessman denton offutt and accompanied by friends he took goods from new salem to new orleans via flatboat on the sangamon illinois and mississippi rivers. while in new orleans he may have witnessed a slave auction though as a frequent visitor to kentucky he would have had several earlier opportunities to witness similar sales. donald 1995 ch. 2.. lincolns formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling. largely selfeducated he read every book he could get his hands on once walking. just to borrow one while his favorite book was the life of george washington lincoln mastered the bible shakespeare and english and american history and developed a plain writing style that puzzled audiences more used to grandiose rhetoric. he was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an ax some rails he had allegedly split in his youth were exhibited at the 1860 republican national convention as the party celebrated the poorboymadegood theme. lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals even for food. though he was unusually tall at 4 inches and strong lincoln spent so much time reading that some neighbors suspected he must be doing it to avoid strenuous manual labor.. young abraham lincoln. lincoln began his political career in 1832 at age 23 with an unsuccessful campaign for the illinois general assembly as a member of the whig party. he ran eighth in a field of 13 candidates. the centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the sangamon river. he believed that this would attract steamboat traffic which would allow the sparsely populated poorer areas along the river to flourish.. he was elected captain of an illinois militia company drawn from new salem during the black hawk war and later wrote that he had not had any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction. thomas 1952 3234 basler 1946 p. 551 though he never saw combat lincoln did assist in burying the dead from the battle of stillmans run the day after major isaiah stillmans troops fled the field of battle. abraham lincoln online retrieved on march 11 2007. for several months lincoln ran a small store in new salem selling tea coffee sugar salt blue calico brown muslin straw hats and whiskey. beveridge 1928 11278 later he found work as village postmaster and as a surveyor.. in 1834 he won election to the state legislature and after coming across the commentaries on the laws of england began to teach himself law. admitted to the bar in 1837 he moved to springfield illinois that same year and began to practice law with john t. stuart. with a reputation as a formidable adversary during crossexaminations and in his closing arguments lincoln became one of the most respected and successful lawyers in illinois and grew steadily more prosperous.. he served four successive terms in the illinois house of representatives as a representative from sangamon county and became a leader of the illinois whig party. in 1837 he made his first protest against slavery in the illinois house stating that the institution was founded on both injustice and bad policy. protest in illinois legislature on slavery p.75 march 3 1837 it was also in this same year that lincoln met joshua fry speed who would become his most intimate friend.. lincoln wrote a series of anonymous letters published in 1842 in the sangamon journal mocking state auditor and prominent democrat james shields. shields would later become a u.s. senator but when he learned that it was lincoln who had been writing the barbs he challenged him to a duel. as shields was the challenger lincoln was granted the right to choose the weapon and specified cavalry broad swords of the largest size. much taller and with long arms this gave him an overwhelming advantage over his opponent however the duel was called off at the last minute. beveridge 1928 1349. lincoln had been practicing with the broad sword. two years later lincoln entered law practice with william herndon a fellow whig. in 1854 both men joined the fledgling republican party. following lincolns death herndon began collecting stories about lincoln and published them in herndons lincoln.. the first photograph ever taken of mary lincoln a daguerreotype by shepherd in 1846.. on november 4 1842 lincoln married mary todd daughter of a prominent slaveowning family from kentucky. the couple had four sons. robert todd lincoln was born in springfield illinois on 1 august 1843. their only child to survive into

the confederacy with one wounded and another killed in action. lieutenant david h. todd a halfbrother of mary todd lincoln served as commandant of the libby prison camp during the war.. the first photograph ever taken of abraham lincoln a daguerreotype taken by shepherd in 1846.. a whig and an admirer of party leader henry clay lincoln was elected to a term in the u.s. house of representatives in 1846. as a freshman house member he was not a particularly powerful or influential figure. he spoke out against the mexicanamerican war which he attributed to president polks desire for military glory that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood. he also challenged the presidents claims regarding the texas boundary and offered spot resolutions demanding to know on what spot on us soil that blood was first spilt. congressional globe 30th session 1848 pp.9395 in january of 1848 he was among the 82 whigs who defeated 81 democrats in a procedural vote on an amendment to send a routine resolution back to committee with instructions to add the words a war unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the president of the united states. the amendment passed but the bill never reemerged from committee and was never finally voted upon. house journal 30th session 1848 pp.183184. lincoln later damaged his political reputation with a speech in which he declared god of heaven has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men women and children and lay waste and pillage the land of the just. two weeks later president polk sent a peace treaty to congress. while no one in washington paid any attention to lincoln the democrats orchestrated angry outbursts from across his district where the war was popular and many had volunteered. in morgan county resolutions were adopted in fervent support of the war and in wrathful denunciation of the treasonable assaults of guerrillas at home party demagogues slanderers of the president defenders of the butchery at the alamo traducers of the heroism at san jacinto. abe lincoln resource page. warned by his law partner william herndon that the damage was mounting and irreparable lincoln decided not to run for reelection. in fact in 1848 he campaigned vigorously for zachary taylor the successful general whose atrocities he had denounced in january. regardless his statements were not easily forgotten and would haunt him during the civil war. these statements were also held against him when he applied for a position in the new taylor administration. instead taylors people offered lincoln various positions in the remote oregon territory primarily the governorship. acceptance of this offer would have ended his career in the rapidly growing state of illinois so lincoln declined the position. returning to springfield lincoln gave up politics for several years and turned his energies to his law practice. during this time he made many trips on horseback between various counties courthouses. beveridge 1928 1 42833 donald 1995 p. 14043.. in the 1920s historical markers were placed at the county lines along the route lincoln traveled in the eight judicial district. this example is on the border of piatt and dewitt counties. by the mid1850s lincolns caseload focused largely on the competing transportation interests of river barges and railroads. in one prominent 1851 case he represented the alton sangamon railroad in a dispute with a shareholder james a. barret. barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to the railroad on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest that the newer route proposed by alton sangamon was superior and less expensive and that accordingly the corporation had a right to sue barret for his delinquent payment. he won this case and the decision by the illinois supreme court was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the united states. donald 1995 ch. 6.. possibly the most notable criminal trial of lincolns career as a lawyer came in 1858 when he defended william duff armstrong who has been charged with murder. the case became famous for lincolns use of judicial noticea rare tactic at that timeto show that an eyewitness had lied on the stand. after the witness testified to having seen the crime by moonlight lincoln produced a farmers almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle that it could not have provided enough illumination to see anything clearly. based almost entirely on this evidence armstrong was acquitted. donald 1995 15051. lincoln was involved in more than 5100 cases in illinois alone during his 23year legal career. though many of these cases involved little more than filing a writ others were more substantial and quite involved. lincoln and his partners appeared before the illinois state supreme court more than 400 times. during one trial lincolns voir dire included a question to prospective jurors as to whether they were acquainted with counsel for the other side. when a few of them turned out to know the other lawyer the judge interrupted saying mr. lincoln you are wasting the time of the court. the fact that a prospective juror knows your opponent does not disqualify him.. no your honor i understand that lincoln answered. im afraid that some of them might not know him which would place me at a disadvantage.. lincoln returned to politics in response to the kansasnebraska act 1854 which expressly repealed the limits on slaverys extent as determined by the missouri compromise 1820. illinois democrat stephen a. douglas the most powerful man in the senate proposed popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse and incorporated it into the kansasnebraska act. douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory rather than have such a decision imposed on them by congress. donald 1995 ch. 7.. in a speech against the act on october 16 1854 delivered in peoria lincoln first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day. drawing on remnants of the old whig free soil liberty and democratic parties he was instrumental in forming the new republican party. in a stirring campaign the republicans carried illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. lincoln was the obvious choice but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an exdemocrat lyman trumbull.. in 185758 douglas broke with president buchanan leading to a fight for control of the democratic party. some eastern republicans even favored the reelection of douglas in 1858 since he had led the opposition to the lecompton constitution which would have admitted kansas as a slave state. accepting the republican nomination for senate in 1858 lincoln delivered his famous speech a house divided against itself cannot stand.mark 325 i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided. it will become all one thing or all the other. a house divided against itself cannot stand june 1858 the speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate and rallied republicans across the north.. the 1858 campaign featured the lincolndouglas debates a nationally famous contest on slavery. lincoln warned that the slave power was threatening the values of republicanism while douglas emphasized the supremacy of democracy as set forth in his freeport doctrine which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not. though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature reelected douglas to the senate. nevertheless lincolns eloquence transformed him into a national political star.. during the debates of 1858 the issue of race was often discussed. during a time period when few believed in racial egalitarianism stephen douglas informed the crowds if you desire negro citizenship if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves then support mr. lincoln and the black republican party who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro. first debate with stephen a. douglas at ottawa illinois august 21 1858 lincoln countered that he was not in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races. fourth debate with stephen a. douglas at charleston illinois september 18 1858 his opposition to slavery was opposition to the slave power though this would change during the course of the civil war. donald 1995 ch. 8.. on may 910 1860 the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur. at this convention lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.. the rail candidate lincolns 1860 candidacy is held up by slavery issue slave on left and party organization new york tribune editor horace greeley on right. photo of lincoln taken february 27 1860 in new york city by mathew brady the day of his famous cooper union speech.. entering the presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog lincoln was eventually chosen as the republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. his expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals william h. seward and salmon p. chase. his western origins also appealed to the newer states other contenders especially those with more governmental experience had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states while lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the west. most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party as the slave power tightened its grasp on the national government. yet despite his southern connections his inlaws owned slaves lincoln misunderstood the depth of the revolution underway in the south and the emergence of southern nationalism. throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession. gabor s. boritt and the war came? abraham lincoln and the question of individual responsibility why the civil war came ed by boritt 1996 pp 330.. throughout the election lincoln did not campaign or give speeches. this was handled by the state and county republican organizations who used the latest techniques to sustain party enthusiasm and thus obtain high turnout. there was little effort to convert nonrepublicans and there was virtually no campaigning in the south except for a few border cities such as st. louis missouri and wheeling virginia indeed the party did not even run a slate in most of the south. in the north there were thousands of republican speakers tons of campaign posters and leaflets and thousands of newspaper editorials. these focused first on the party platform and second on lincolns life story making the most of his boyhood poverty his pioneer background his native genius and his rise from obscurity. his nicknames honest abe and the railsplitter were exploited to the full. the goal was to emphasize the superior power of free labor whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. thomas 1952 p 216 reinhard h. luthin the first lincoln campaign 1944 nevins vol 4. on november 6 1860 lincoln was elected as the 16th president of the united states beating democrat stephen a. douglas john c. breckinridge of the southern democrats and john bell of the new constitutional union party. he was the first republican president winning entirely on the strength of his support in the north he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the south and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other southern states. lincoln gained 1865908 votes 39.9 of the total for 180 electoral votes douglas 1380202 29.5 for 12 electoral votes breckenridge 848019 18.1 for 72 electoral votes and bell 590901 12.5 for 39 electoral votes. there were fusion tickets in some states but even if his opponents had combined in every state lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election.. as lincolns election became more likely secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the union. south carolina took the lead followed by six other cottongrowing states in the deep south. the upper south delaware maryland virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri and arkansas listened to and rejected the secessionist appeal. they decided to stay in the union though they warned lincoln that they would not support an invasion through their territory. the seven confederate states seceded before lincoln took office declaring themselves to be a new nation the confederate states of america. president buchanan and presidentelect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy.. presidentelect lincoln evaded possible assassins in baltimore and on february 23 1861 arrived in disguise in washington d.c. at his inauguration on march 4 1861 the german american turners formed lincolns bodyguard and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present ready to protect the capital from confederate invasion and local insurrection.. photograph showing the march 4 1861 inauguration of abraham lincoln in front of united states capitol.. in his first inaugural address lincoln declared i hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution the union of these states is perpetual. perpetuity is implied if not expressed in the fundamental law of all national governments arguing further that the purpose of the united states constitution was to form a more perfect union than the articles of confederation which were explicitly perpetual thus the constitution too was perpetual. he asked rhetorically that even were the constitution a simple contract would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?. also in his inaugural address in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war lincoln supported the pending corwin amendment to the constitution which had already passed congress. this amendment which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it existed was designed to appeal not to the confederacy but to the critical border states. at the same time lincoln adamantly opposed the crittenden compromise which would have permitted slavery in the territories. despite support for the crittenden compromise among some prominent republicans including william seward lincoln denounced it saying that it would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people tribe and state owning a foot of land between here and tierra del fuego.. by the time lincoln took office the confederacy was an established fact and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the union on any terms. no compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. lincoln might have allowed the southern states to secede and some republicans recommended that. however conservative democratic nationalists such as jeremiah s. black joseph holt and edwin m. stanton had taken control of buchanans cabinet around january 1 1861 and refused to accept secession. lincoln and nearly every republican leader adopted this position by march 1861 the union could not be dismantled. however as a strict follower of the constitution lincoln refused to take any action against the south unless the unionists themselves were attacked first. this finally happened in april 1861.. historian allan nevins argues that lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the union hold government property and still avoid war. he temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis overestimated the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and border states and misunderstood the conditional support of unionists in the border states. allan nevins the improvised war 18611862 1959 p 29. in april 1861 after union troops at fort sumter were fired upon and forced to surrender lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75000 troops to recapture forts protect the capital and preserve the union which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. virginia which had repeatedly warned lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state responded by seceding along with north carolina tennessee and arkansas.. the slave states of missouri kentucky maryland and delaware did not secede and lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there promising not to interfere with slavery. after the fighting started he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas especially in maryland and held in military prisons without trial. over 18000 were arrested though none were executed. one clement vallandigham was exiled but all of the remainder were released usually after two or three months see ex parte merryman.. lincoln met with his cabinet for the first reading of the emancipation proclamation draft on july 22 1862. lr edwin m. stanton salmon p. chase abraham lincoln gideon welles caleb b. smith william h. seward montgomery blair and edward bates. in july 1862 congress moved to free the slaves by passing the second confiscation act. the goal was to weaken the rebellion which was led and controlled by slave owners. while it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery the thirteenth amendment did that the act showed that lincoln had the support of congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. this new law was implemented with lincolns emancipation proclamation.. lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the united states. in 1861 1862 however he made it clear that the north was fighting the war to preserve the union not to abolish slavery. freeing the slaves became in late 1862 a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. abolitionists criticized lincoln for his sluggishness over slavery per se but on august 22 1862 lincoln explained. the emancipation proclamation announced on september 22 and put into effect on january 1 1863 freed slaves in territories not under union control. as union armies advanced south more slaves were liberated until all of them in confederate hands over three million were freed. lincoln later said i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper. the proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the thirteenth amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation. lincoln addressed the issue of his consistency in an 1864 letter to albert g. hodges. letter to albert g. hodges april 4 1864. in september 1862 thirteen northern governors met in altoona pennsylvania at the loyal war governors conference to discuss the proclamation and union war effort. in the end the state executives fully supported the presidents proclamation and also suggested the removal of general george b. mcclellan as commander of the unions army of the potomac. images of america altoona by sr. anne francis pulling 2001 10.. for some time lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. he commented favorably on colonization in the emancipation proclamation but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. as frederick douglass observed lincoln was the first great man that i talked with in the united states freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself of the difference of color. life and times of frederick douglass by frederick douglass 1895. after union victories at gettysburg vicksburg and chattanooga in 1863 victory seemed at hand and lincoln promoted ulysses s. grant generalinchief march 12 1864. when the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates lincoln supported grants strategy of wearing down lees confederate army at the cost of heavy union casualties. with an election looming he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. at the convention the republican party selected andrew johnson a war democrat from the southern state of tennessee as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. they ran on the new union party ticket uniting republicans and war democrats.. lincoln in top hat with allan pinkerton and gen. john alexander mcclernand at antietam.. nevertheless republicans across the country feared that lincoln would be defeated. acknowledging this fear lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that if he should lose the election he would nonetheless defeat the confederacy by an allout military effort before turning over the white house mark grimsley and brooks d simpson eds. the collapse of the confederacy 2001 p 80. lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.. while the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war a failure their candidate general george b. mcclellan supported the war and repudiated the platform.. lincoln provided grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to support grant and win local support for the war effort. shermans capture of atlanta in september ended defeatist jitters the democratic party was deeply split with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln the union party was united and energized and lincoln was easily reelected in a landslide. he won all but two states capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.. on march 4 1865 lincoln delivered his second inaugural address his favorite of all his speeches. at this time a victory over the rebels was at hand slavery was dead and lincoln was looking to the future.. running the machine. an 1864 cartoon featuring lincoln william fessenden edwin stanton william seward and gideon welles takes a swing at the lincoln administration. the war was a source of constant frustration for the president and occupied nearly all of his time. he had a contentious relationship with general mcclellan who became generalinchief of all the union armies in the wake of the embarrassing union defeat at the first battle of bull run and after the retirement of winfield scott in late 1861. despite his inexperience in military affairs lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. his priorities were twofold to ensure that washington d.c. was well defended and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the northern public and press. mcclellan a youthful west point graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service took a more cautious approach. he took several months to plan and execute his peninsula campaign with the objective of capturing richmond by moving the army of the potomac by boat to the peninsula between the james and york rivers. mcclellans delay irritated lincoln as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend washington d.c. lincoln insisted on holding some of mcclellans troops to defend the capital a decision mcclellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the peninsula campaign.. mcclellan a lifelong democrat who was temperamentally conservative was relieved as generalinchief after releasing his harrisons landing letter where he offered unsolicited political advice to lincoln urging caution in the war effort. mcclellans letter incensed radical republicans who successfully pressured lincoln to appoint john pope a republican as head of the new army of virginia. pope complied with lincolns strategic desire to move toward richmond from the north thus protecting the capital from attack. but pope was soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of 1862 forcing the army of the potomac to defend washington for a second time. in response to his failure pope was sent to minnesota to fight the sioux.. an 1864 mathew brady photo depicts president lincoln reading a book with his youngest son tad. panicked by lees invasion of maryland lincoln restored mcclellan to command of all forces around washington in time for the battle of antietam september 1862. the ensuing union victory enabled lincoln to release his emancipation proclamation but he relieved mcclellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed republican ambrose burnside to head the army of the potomac. burnside had promised to follow through on lincolns strategic vision for a strong offensive against lee and richmond. after burnside was stunningly defeated at fredericksburg joseph hooker was given the command despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders. joseph hooker biography hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville may 1863 and relieved of command early in the subsequent gettysburg campaign replaced by george meade.. after the union victory at gettysburg meades failure to pursue lee and months of inactivity for the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln to bring in a western general ulysses s. grant. grant already had a solid string of victories in the western theater including the battles of vicksburg and chattanooga. responding to criticism of grant lincoln was quoted as saying i cannot spare this man. he fights. grant waged his bloody overland campaign in 1864 with a strategy of a war of attrition characterized by high union losses at battles such as the wilderness and cold harbor but by proportionately higher confederate losses. his invasion campaign eventually bottled lee up in the siege of petersburg so that grant could take richmond and bring the war to a close in the spring of 1865.. lincoln authorized grant to target civilians and infrastructure hoping to destroy the souths morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. this allowed generals sherman and sheridan to destroy farms and towns in the shenandoah valley georgia and south carolina. the damage caused by shermans march to the sea through georgia totaled in excess of 100 million by shermans own estimate. see hofstadter richard the united states the history of a republic prenticehall 1967 p. 446.. lincoln had a starcrossed record as a military leader possessing a keen understanding of strategic points such as the mississippi river and the fortress city of vicksburg and the importance of defeating the enemys army rather than simply capturing cities. he had however limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863 when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in ulysses s. grant. only then could he insist on using african american troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.. throughout the war lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. he spent hours at the war department telegraph office reading dispatches from his generals. he visited battle sites frequently and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. during jubal anderson earlys raid on washington d.c. in 1864 lincoln had to be told to duck to avoid being shot while observing the battle.. reconstruction began during the war as lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the southern states and what to do with confederate leaders and the freed slaves. lincoln led the moderates regarding reconstructionist policy and was usually opposed by the radical republicans under thaddeus stevens in the house and charles sumner and benjamin wade in the senate though he cooperated with these men on most other issues. determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the south lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind union lines. his amnesty proclamation of december 8 1863 offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office had not mistreated union prisoners and would sign an oath of allegiance. ref critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. of special importance were tennessee where lincoln appointed andrew johnson as governor and louisiana where lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. the radicals thought this policy too lenient and passed their own plan the wadedavis bill in 1864. when lincoln pocketvetoed the bill the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from louisiana arkansas and tennessee. donald 1995 ch. 20. on april 9 1865 lee surrendered at appomattox court house in virginia and the war was effectively over. the other rebel armies surrendered soon after and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare. lincoln went to richmond to make a public gesture of sitting at jefferson daviss own desk symbolically saying to the nation that the president of the united states held authority over the entire land. he was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirers quote i know i am free for i have seen the face of father abraham and have felt him. when a general asked lincoln how the defeated confederates should be treated lincoln replied let em up easy. donald 1995 576 580 president lincoln enters richmond 1865 eyewitness to history www.eywitnesstohistory.com 2000.. one of the last photographs of lincoln likely taken between february and april 1865. lincolns powerful rhetoric defined the issues of the war for the nation the world and posterity. his extraordinary command of the english language was evidenced in the gettysburg address a speech dedicating the cemetery at gettysburg that he delivered on november 19 1863. the speech defied lincolns own prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here. lincolns second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted. in these speeches lincoln articulated better than anyone else the rationale behind the union cause.. in recent years historians have stressed lincolns use of and redefinition of republican values. as early as the 1850s a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the constitution lincoln shifted emphasis to the declaration of independence as the foundation of american political valueswhat he called the sheet anchor of republicanism. jaffa 2000 p. 399 the declarations emphasis on freedom and equality for all rather than the constitutions tolerance of slavers shifted the debate. as diggins concludes regarding the highly influential cooper union speech lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself. john patrick diggins the lost soul of american politics virtue selfinterest and the foundations of liberalism 1986 p. 307. his position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism rather than its legalisms. foner 1970 p. 215 says lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism. see also mcpherson 1992 pp.6164. nevertheless in 1861 lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms the constitution was a contract and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state. jaffa 2000 p. 263 that duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in reconstruction.. lincolns second inauguration on march 4 1865. in the photo lincolns assassin john wilkes booth can be seen in the crowd at the top and accomplices david herold lewis powell george atzerodt john surratt and edmund spangler in the bottom crowd. in his gettysburg address lincoln redefined the american nation arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776 conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. he declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth. by emphasizing the centrality of the nation he rebuffed the claims of state sovereignty. while some critics say lincoln moved too far and too fast h.l. mencken said it is difficult to imagine anything more untrue. the union soldiers in the battle actually fought against selfdetermination it was the confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves. mencken did not mention the right of selfdetermination rights for blacks. they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked a new founding of the nation. wills 1992 p. 39.. during the civil war lincoln appropriated powers no previous president had wielded he used his war powers to proclaim a blockade suspended the writ of habeas corpus spent money without congressional authorization and imprisoned 18000 suspected confederate sympathizers without trial. nearly all of his actions although vehemently denounced by the copperheads were subsequently upheld by congress and the courts.. lincoln believed in the whig theory of the presidency which left congress to write the laws while he signed them vetoing only those bills that threatened his war powers. thus he signed the homestead act in 1862 making millions of acres of governmentheld land in the west available for purchase at very low cost. the morrill landgrant colleges act also signed in 1862 provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state. the pacific railway acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the united states first transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869. other important legislation involved economic matters including the first income tax and higher tariffs. also included was the creation of the system of national banks by the national banking acts of 1863 1864 and 1865 which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system. congress created and lincoln approved the department of agriculture in 1862 although that institution would not become a cabinetlevel department until 1889.. the legal tender act of 1862 established the united states note the first paper currency in united states history. this was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.. during the war lincolns treasury department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied souththe most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.. in 1862 lincoln sent a senior general john pope to put down the sioux uprising in minnesota. presented with 303 death warrants for convicted santee dakota who had massacred innocent farmers lincoln

dying of his wounds soon after.. an army surgeon doctor charles leale initially assessed lincolns wound as mortal. the president was taken across the street from the theater to the petersen house where he lay in a coma for nine hours before he died. several physicians attended lincoln including u.s. army surgeon general joseph k. barnes of the army medical museum. using a probe barnes located some fragments of lincolns skull and the ball lodged 6 inches 15 cm inside his brain. lincoln never regained consciousness and was officially pronounced dead at 72210 a.m. april 15 1865 at the age of 56. there is some disagreement among historians as to stantons words after lincoln died. all agree that he began now he belongs to the... with some stating he said ages while others believe he said angels. after lincolns body was returned to the white house his body was prepared for his lying in repose in the east room. he was the first president to lie in state.. the army medical museum now named the national museum of health and medicine has retained in its collection several artifacts relating to the assassination. currently on display are the bullet that was fired from the derringer pistol the probe used by barnes pieces of lincolns skull and hair and the surgeons cuff stained with lincolns blood.. lincolns funeral train carried his remains as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son william 1654 miles 2661 km to illinois . lincolns body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to illinois. while much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the united states copperheads celebrated the death of a man they considered an unconstitutional tyrant. the lincoln tomb in oak ridge cemetery in springfield is 177 feet 54 m tall and by 1874 was surmounted with several bronze statues of lincoln. to prevent repeated attempts to steal lincolns body and hold it for ransom robert todd lincoln had lincoln exhumed and reinterred in concrete several feet thick in 1901.. with over 120 photographs taken of him lincoln was the most photographed man in the united states up to the time he was assassinated.. lincoln was known for appointing political rivals to high positions in his cabinet to keep in line all factions of his party and to let them battle each other and not combine against lincoln. historians agree that except for simon cameron it was a highly effective group.. abraham lincolns official white house portrait. lincoln appointed the following justices to the supreme court of the united states. in march 1860 in a speech in new haven connecticut lincoln said with respect to slavery whenever this question shall be settled it must be settled on some philosophical basis. no policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained. the philosophical basis for lincolns beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that lincoln be examined seriously as a man of ideas. lincoln was a strong supporter of the american whig version of liberal capitalism who more than most politicians of the time was able to express his ideas within the context of nineteenth century religious beliefs. guelzo pg. 1819. there were few people who strongly or directly influenced lincolns moral and intellectual development and perspectives. there was no teacher mentor church leader community leader or peer that lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. lacking a formal education lincolns personal philosophy was shaped by an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning. it was lincolns reading rather than his relationships that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs. guelzo pg. 20. miller pg. 5759 lincolns reading and study of the bible was an integral part of his intellectual roots.. lincoln did even as a boy largely reject organized religion but the calvinistic doctrine of necessity would remain a factor throughout his life. in 1846 lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as that the human mind is impelled to action or held in rest by some power over which the mind itself has no control. donald pg. 15. the quote came from a letter to the public in which lincoln was denying charges by a political opponent that he was a religious scoffer. in april 1864 in justifying his actions in regard to emancipation lincoln wrote i claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me. now at the end of three years struggle the nations condition is not what either party or any man devised or expected. god alone can claim it. donald pg. 514. as lincoln matured and especially during his term as president the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. on a personal level the death of his son willie in february 1862 may have caused lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace. wilson pg. 251254 after willies death in the summer or early fall of 1862 lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why from a divine standpoint the severity of the war was necessary. lincolns religious skepticism was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the lockean enlightenment and classical liberalism especially economic liberalism. guelzo pg. 20 consistent with the common practice of the whig party lincoln would often use the declaration of independence as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies. guelzo pg.194 in a february 22 1861 speech at independence hall in philadelphia lincoln said. he found in the declaration justification for whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the nativist platform of the know nothings. in claiming that all men were created free lincoln and the whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement expanded education territory to grow and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population. guelzo pg.194195. it was the declaration of independence rather than the bible that lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. he saw the declaration as more than a political document. to him as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders it was foremost a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation. miller pg. 297. while lincoln is usually portrayed bearded he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11yearold grace bedell. lincolns death made the president a martyr to many. repeated polls of historians have ranked lincoln as among the greatest presidents in u.s. history often appearing in the first position. among contemporary admirers lincoln is usually seen as personifying classical values of honesty and integrity as well as respect for individual and minority rights and human freedom in general.. many american organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image with interests ranging from the gay rightssupporting log cabin republicans to the insurance corporation lincoln national corporation. the lincoln automobile is also named after him. the ballistic missile submarine abraham lincoln ssbn602 and the aircraft carrier abraham lincoln cvn72 were named in his honor. also the liberty ship ss nancy hanks was named to honor his mother. during the spanish civil war the american faction of the international brigades named themselves the abraham lincoln brigade after lincoln.. lincoln has been memorialized in many city names notably the capital of nebraska. lincoln illinois is the only city to be named for abraham lincoln before he became president. lincolns name and image appear in numerous places. these include the lincoln memorial in washington d.c. the u.s. lincoln 5 bill and the lincoln cent

opponent of the expansion of slavery in the united states in his short autobiography written for the 1860 presidential campaign lincoln would describe his protest in the illinois legislature as one that briefly defined his position on the slavery question and so far as it goes it was then the same that it is now. this was in reference to the antiexpansion sentiments he had then expressed. doris kearns goodwin team of rivals the political genius of abraham lincoln 2005 p. 91. holzer pg. 232. writing of the cooper union speech holzer notes cooper union proved a unique confluence of political culture rhetorical opportunity technological innovation and human genius and it brought abraham lincoln to the center stage of american politics at precisely the right time and place and with precisely the right message that slavery was wrong and ought to be confined to the areas where it already existed and placed on the course of ultimate extinction... . lincoln won the republican party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year. during his term he helped preserve the united states by leading the defeat of the secessionist confederate states of america in the american civil war. he introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery issuing his emancipation proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the thirteenth amendment to the constitution in 1865.. lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort especially the selection of top generals including ulysses s. grant. historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the republican party well bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. lincoln successfully defused a war scare with the united kingdom in 1861. under his leadership the union took control of the border slave states at the start of the war. additionally he managed his own reelection in the 1864 presidential election.. opponents of the war also known as copperheads criticized him for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. conversely the radical republicans an abolitionist faction of the republican party criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. even with these problems lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches his gettysburg address is but one example of this. at the close of the war lincoln held a moderate view of reconstruction seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. his assassination in 1865 was the first presidential assassination in u.s. history and made him a martyr for the ideal of national unity.. scholars now rank lincoln among the top three u.s. presidents with the majority of those surveyed placing him first. he is noted for his lasting influence on u.s. politics including a redefinition of republicanism. as diggins explains lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself. john patrick diggins the lost soul of american politics virtue selfinterest and the foundations of liberalism 1986 p. 307. foner 1970 p. 215 noted that lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism. jaffa 2000 p. 399 stresses lincolns emphasis on the declaration of independence as what lincoln called the sheet anchor of republicanism. see also mcpherson 1992 pp.6164.. abraham lincoln was born on february 12 1809 to thomas lincoln and nancy hanks two uneducated farmers. lincoln was born in a oneroom log cabin on the sinking spring farm in southeast hardin county kentucky now part of larue county. this area was at the time considered the frontier. the name abraham was chosen to commemorate his grandfather who was killed in an american indian raid in 1786. donald 1995 p 21 his elder sister sarah lincoln was born in 1807 a younger brother thomas jr died in infancy. it is sometimes debated whether lincoln had marfan syndrome an autosomal dominant disorder of the connective tissue characterized by long limbs and great physical stature. marfan syndrome introduction aug 1 2006. symbolic log cabin at abraham lincoln birthplace national historic site.. for some time thomas lincoln was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the kentucky back country. he had purchased the sinking spring farm in december of 1808 for 200 cash and assumption of a debt. the farm site is now preserved as part of abraham lincoln birthplace national historic site. the family belonged to a baptist church that had seceded from a larger church over the issue of slavery. though lincoln was exposed to his parents antislavery sentiment from a very young age he never joined their church or any other church for that matter. as a youth he had little use for religion. life of abraham lincoln colonel ward h. lamon 1872 portions reprinted in chapter viii abraham lincoln deist and admirer of thomas paine from the book religious beliefs of our presidents by franklin steiner 1936. lincoln was just seven years old when in 1816 the family was forced to make a new start in perry county now in spencer county indiana. he later noted that this move was partly on account of slavery and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in kentucky unlike land in the northwest territory kentucky never had a proper u.s. survey and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property. lincoln was only nine when his mother then thirtyfour years old died of milk sickness. soon afterwards his father remarried to sarah bush johnston. sarah lincoln raised young lincoln like one of her own children. years later she compared lincoln to her own son saying both were good boys but i must say both now being dead that abe was the best boy i ever saw or ever expect to see. lincoln was affectionate toward his stepmother whom he would call mother for the rest of his life but he was distant from his father. donald 1995 pp. 28 152.. in 1830 after more economic and landtitle difficulties in indiana the family settled on public land ref in macon county illinois. some scholars believe that it was his fathers repeated landtitle difficulties and ensuing financial hardships that led young lincoln to study law. the following winter was desolate and especially brutal and the family considered moving back to indiana. the following year when his father relocated the family to a new homestead in coles county illinois twentytwoyearold lincoln struck out on his own canoeing down the sangamon river to the village of new salem in sangamon county. later that year hired by new salem businessman denton offutt and accompanied by friends he took goods from new salem to new orleans via flatboat on the sangamon illinois and mississippi rivers. while in new orleans he may have witnessed a slave auction though as a frequent visitor to kentucky he would have had several earlier opportunities to witness similar sales. donald 1995 ch. 2.. lincolns formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling. largely selfeducated he read every book he could get his hands on once walking. just to borrow one while his favorite book was the life of george washington lincoln mastered the bible shakespeare and english and american history and developed a plain writing style that puzzled audiences more used to grandiose rhetoric. he was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an ax some rails he had allegedly split in his youth were exhibited at the 1860 republican national convention as the party celebrated the poorboymadegood theme. lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals even for food. though he was unusually tall at 4 inches and strong lincoln spent so much time reading that some neighbors suspected he must be doing it to avoid strenuous manual labor.. young abraham lincoln. lincoln began his political career in 1832 at age 23 with an unsuccessful campaign for the illinois general assembly as a member of the whig party. he ran eighth in a field of 13 candidates. the centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the sangamon river. he believed that this would attract steamboat traffic which would allow the sparsely populated poorer areas along the river to flourish.. he was elected captain of an illinois militia company drawn from new salem during the black hawk war and later wrote that he had not had any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction. thomas 1952 3234 basler 1946 p. 551 though he never saw combat lincoln did assist in burying the dead from the battle of stillmans run the day after major isaiah stillmans troops fled the field of battle. abraham lincoln online retrieved on march 11 2007. for several months lincoln ran a small store in new salem selling tea coffee sugar salt blue calico brown muslin straw hats and whiskey. beveridge 1928 11278 later he found work as village postmaster and as a surveyor.. in 1834 he won election to the state legislature and after coming across the commentaries on the laws of england began to teach himself law. admitted to the bar in 1837 he moved to springfield illinois that same year and began to practice law with john t. stuart. with a reputation as a formidable adversary during crossexaminations and in his closing arguments lincoln became one of the most respected and successful lawyers in illinois and grew steadily more prosperous.. he served four successive terms in the illinois house of representatives as a representative from sangamon county and became a leader of the illinois whig party. in 1837 he made his first protest against slavery in the illinois house stating that the institution was founded on both injustice and bad policy. protest in illinois legislature on slavery p.75 march 3 1837 it was also in this same year that lincoln met joshua fry speed who would become his most intimate friend.. lincoln wrote a series of anonymous letters published in 1842 in the sangamon journal mocking state auditor and prominent democrat james shields. shields would later become a u.s. senator but when he learned that it was lincoln who had been writing the barbs he challenged him to a duel. as shields was the challenger lincoln was granted the right to choose the weapon and specified cavalry broad swords of the largest size. much taller and with long arms this gave him an overwhelming advantage over his opponent however the duel was called off at the last minute. beveridge 1928 1349. lincoln had been practicing with the broad sword. two years later lincoln entered law practice with william herndon a fellow whig. in 1854 both men joined the fledgling republican party. following lincolns death herndon began collecting stories about lincoln and published them in herndons lincoln.. the first photograph ever taken of mary lincoln a daguerreotype by shepherd in 1846.. on november 4 1842 lincoln married mary todd daughter of a prominent slaveowning family from kentucky. the couple had four sons. robert todd lincoln was born in springfield illinois on 1 august 1843. their only child to survive into adulthood young robert attended phillips exeter academy and harvard college. robert died on july 26 1926 in manchester vermont.. the other lincoln children were born in springfield illinois and died either during childhood or their teen years. edward baker lincoln was born on march 10 1846 and died on 1 february 1850 also in springfield. william wallace lincoln was born on december 21 1850 and died on february 20 1862 in washington d.c. during pres. lincolns first term. thomas tad lincoln was born on 4 april 1853 and died on july 16 1871 in chicago.. four of his wifes brothers fought for the confederacy with one wounded and another killed in action. lieutenant david h. todd a halfbrother of mary todd lincoln served as commandant of the libby prison camp during the war.. the first photograph ever taken of abraham lincoln a daguerreotype taken by shepherd in 1846.. a whig and an admirer of party leader henry clay lincoln was elected to a term in the u.s. house of representatives in 1846. as a freshman house member he was not a particularly powerful or influential figure. he spoke out against the mexicanamerican war which he attributed to president polks desire for military glory that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood. he also challenged the presidents claims regarding the texas boundary and offered spot resolutions demanding to know on what spot on us soil that blood was first spilt. congressional globe 30th session 1848 pp.9395 in january of 1848 he was among the 82 whigs who defeated 81 democrats in a procedural vote on an amendment to send a routine resolution back to committee with instructions to add the words a war unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the president of the united states. the amendment passed but the bill never reemerged from committee and was never finally voted upon. house journal 30th session 1848 pp.183184. lincoln later damaged his political reputation with a speech in which he declared god of heaven has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men women and children and lay waste and pillage the land of the just. two weeks later president polk sent a peace treaty to congress. while no one in washington paid any attention to lincoln the democrats orchestrated angry outbursts from across his district where the war was popular and many had volunteered. in morgan county resolutions were adopted in fervent support of the war and in wrathful denunciation of the treasonable assaults of guerrillas at home party demagogues slanderers of the president defenders of the butchery at the alamo traducers of the heroism at san jacinto. abe lincoln resource page. warned by his law partner william herndon that the damage was mounting and irreparable lincoln decided not to run for reelection. in fact in 1848 he campaigned vigorously for zachary taylor the successful general whose atrocities he had denounced in january. regardless his statements were not easily forgotten and would haunt him during the civil war. these statements were also held against him when he applied for a position in the new taylor administration. instead taylors people offered lincoln various positions in the remote oregon territory primarily the governorship. acceptance of this offer would have ended his career in the rapidly growing state of illinois so lincoln declined the position. returning to springfield lincoln gave up politics for several years and turned his energies to his law practice. during this time he made many trips on horseback between various counties courthouses. beveridge 1928 1 42833 donald 1995 p. 14043.. in the 1920s historical markers were placed at the county lines along the route lincoln traveled in the eight judicial district. this example is on the border of piatt and dewitt counties. by the mid1850s lincolns caseload focused largely on the competing transportation interests of river barges and railroads. in one prominent 1851 case he represented the alton sangamon railroad in a dispute with a shareholder james a. barret. barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to the railroad on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest that the newer route proposed by alton sangamon was superior and less expensive and that accordingly the corporation had a right to sue barret for his delinquent payment. he won this case and the decision by the illinois supreme court was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the united states. donald 1995 ch. 6.. possibly the most notable criminal trial of lincolns career as a lawyer came in 1858 when he defended william duff armstrong who has been charged with murder. the case became famous for lincolns use of judicial noticea rare tactic at that timeto show that an eyewitness had lied on the stand. after the witness testified to having seen the crime by moonlight lincoln produced a farmers almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle that it could not have provided enough illumination to see anything clearly. based almost entirely on this evidence armstrong was acquitted. donald 1995 15051. lincoln was involved in more than 5100 cases in illinois alone during his 23year legal career. though many of these cases involved little more than filing a writ others were more substantial and quite involved. lincoln and his partners appeared before the illinois state supreme court more than 400 times. during one trial lincolns voir dire included a question to prospective jurors as to whether they were acquainted with counsel for the other side. when a few of them turned out to know the other lawyer the judge interrupted saying mr. lincoln you are wasting the time of the court. the fact that a prospective juror knows your opponent does not disqualify him.. no your honor i understand that lincoln answered. im afraid that some of them might not know him which would place me at a disadvantage.. lincoln returned to politics in response to the kansasnebraska act 1854 which expressly repealed the limits on slaverys extent as determined by the missouri compromise 1820. illinois democrat stephen a. douglas the most powerful man in the senate proposed popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse and incorporated it into the kansasnebraska act. douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory rather than have such a decision imposed on them by congress. donald 1995 ch. 7.. in a speech against the act on october 16 1854 delivered in peoria lincoln first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day. drawing on remnants of the old whig free soil liberty and democratic parties he was instrumental in forming the new republican party. in a stirring campaign the republicans carried illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. lincoln was the obvious choice but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an exdemocrat lyman trumbull.. in 185758 douglas broke with president buchanan leading to a fight for control of the democratic party. some eastern republicans even favored the reelection of douglas in 1858 since he had led the opposition to the lecompton constitution which would have admitted kansas as a slave state. accepting the republican nomination for senate in 1858 lincoln delivered his famous speech a house divided against itself cannot stand.mark 325 i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided. it will become all one thing or all the other. a house divided against itself cannot stand june 1858 the speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate and rallied republicans across the north.. the 1858 campaign featured the lincolndouglas debates a nationally famous contest on slavery. lincoln warned that the slave power was threatening the values of republicanism while douglas emphasized the supremacy of democracy as set forth in his freeport doctrine which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not. though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature reelected douglas to the senate. nevertheless lincolns eloquence transformed him into a national political star.. during the debates of 1858 the issue of race was often discussed. during a time period when few believed in racial egalitarianism stephen douglas informed the crowds if you desire negro citizenship if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves then support mr. lincoln and the black republican party who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro. first debate with stephen a. douglas at ottawa illinois august 21 1858 lincoln countered that he was not in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races. fourth debate with stephen a. douglas at charleston illinois september 18 1858 his opposition to slavery was opposition to the slave power though this would change during the course of the civil war. donald 1995 ch. 8.. on may 910 1860 the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur. at this convention lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.. the rail candidate lincolns 1860 candidacy is held up by slavery issue slave on left and party organization new york tribune editor horace greeley on right. photo of lincoln taken february 27 1860 in new york city by mathew brady the day of his famous cooper union speech.. entering the presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog lincoln was eventually chosen as the republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. his expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals william h. seward and salmon p. chase. his western origins also appealed to the newer states other contenders especially those with more governmental experience had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states while lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the west. most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party as the slave power tightened its grasp on the national government. yet despite his southern connections his inlaws owned slaves lincoln misunderstood the depth of the revolution underway in the south and the emergence of southern nationalism. throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession. gabor s. boritt and the war came? abraham lincoln and the question of individual responsibility why the civil war came ed by boritt 1996 pp 330.. throughout the election lincoln did not campaign or give speeches. this was handled by the state and county republican organizations who used the latest techniques to sustain party enthusiasm and thus obtain high turnout. there was little effort to convert nonrepublicans and there was virtually no campaigning in the south except for a few border cities such as st. louis missouri and wheeling virginia indeed the party did not even run a slate in most of the south. in the north there were thousands of republican speakers tons of campaign posters and leaflets and thousands of newspaper editorials. these focused first on the party platform and second on lincolns life story making the most of his boyhood poverty his pioneer background his native genius and his rise from obscurity. his nicknames honest abe and the railsplitter were exploited to the full. the goal was to emphasize the superior power of free labor whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. thomas 1952 p 216 reinhard h. luthin the first lincoln campaign 1944 nevins vol 4. on november 6 1860 lincoln was elected as the 16th president of the united states beating democrat stephen a. douglas john c. breckinridge of the southern democrats and john bell of the new constitutional union party. he was the first republican president winning entirely on the strength of his support in the north he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the south and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other southern states. lincoln gained 1865908 votes 39.9 of the total for 180 electoral votes douglas 1380202 29.5 for 12 electoral votes breckenridge 848019 18.1 for 72 electoral votes and bell 590901 12.5 for 39 electoral votes. there were fusion tickets in some states but even if his opponents had combined in every state lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election.. as lincolns election became more likely secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the union. south carolina took the lead followed by six other cottongrowing states in the deep south. the upper south delaware maryland virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri and arkansas listened to and rejected the secessionist appeal. they decided to stay in the union though they warned lincoln that they would not support an invasion through their territory. the seven confederate states seceded before lincoln took office declaring themselves to be a new nation the confederate states of america. president buchanan and presidentelect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy.. presidentelect lincoln evaded possible assassins in baltimore and on february 23 1861 arrived in disguise in washington d.c. at his inauguration on march 4 1861 the german american turners formed lincolns bodyguard and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present ready to protect the capital from confederate invasion and local insurrection.. photograph showing the march 4 1861 inauguration of abraham lincoln in front of united states capitol.. in his first inaugural address lincoln declared i hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution the union of these states is perpetual. perpetuity is implied if not expressed in the fundamental law of all national governments arguing further that the purpose of the united states constitution was to form a more perfect union than the articles of confederation which were explicitly perpetual thus the constitution too was perpetual. he asked rhetorically that even were the constitution a simple contract would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?. also in his inaugural address in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war lincoln supported the pending corwin amendment to the constitution which had already passed congress. this amendment which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it existed was designed to appeal not to the confederacy but to the critical border states. at the same time lincoln adamantly opposed the crittenden compromise which would have permitted slavery in the territories. despite support for the crittenden compromise among some prominent republicans including william seward lincoln denounced it saying that it would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people tribe and state owning a foot of land between here and tierra del fuego.. by the time lincoln took office the confederacy was an established fact and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the union on any terms. no compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. lincoln might have allowed the southern states to secede and some republicans recommended that. however conservative democratic nationalists such as jeremiah s. black joseph holt and edwin m. stanton had taken control of buchanans cabinet around january 1 1861 and refused to accept secession. lincoln and nearly every republican leader adopted this position by march 1861 the union could not be dismantled. however as a strict follower of the constitution lincoln refused to take any action against the south unless the unionists themselves were attacked first. this finally happened in april 1861.. historian allan nevins argues that lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the union hold government property and still avoid war. he temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis overestimated the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and border states and misunderstood the conditional support of unionists in the border states. allan nevins the improvised war 18611862 1959 p 29. in april 1861 after union troops at fort sumter were fired upon and forced to surrender lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75000 troops to recapture forts protect the capital and preserve the union which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. virginia which had repeatedly warned lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state responded by seceding along with north carolina tennessee and arkansas.. the slave states of missouri kentucky maryland and delaware did not secede and lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there promising not to interfere with slavery. after the fighting started he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas especially in maryland and held in military prisons without trial. over 18000 were arrested though none were executed. one clement vallandigham was exiled but all of the remainder were released usually after two or three months see ex parte merryman.. lincoln met with his cabinet for the first reading of the emancipation proclamation draft on july 22 1862. lr edwin m. stanton salmon p. chase abraham lincoln gideon welles caleb b. smith william h. seward montgomery blair and edward bates. in july 1862 congress moved to free the slaves by passing the second confiscation act. the goal was to weaken the rebellion which was led and controlled by slave owners. while it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery the thirteenth amendment did that the act showed that lincoln had the support of congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. this new law was implemented with lincolns emancipation proclamation.. lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the united states. in 1861 1862 however he made it clear that the north was fighting the war to preserve the union not to abolish slavery. freeing the slaves became in late 1862 a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. abolitionists criticized lincoln for his sluggishness over slavery per se but on august 22 1862 lincoln explained. the emancipation proclamation announced on september 22 and put into effect on january 1 1863 freed slaves in territories not under union control. as union armies advanced south more slaves were liberated until all of them in confederate hands over three million were freed. lincoln later said i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper. the proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the thirteenth amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation. lincoln addressed the issue of his consistency in an 1864 letter to albert g. hodges. letter to albert g. hodges april 4 1864. in september 1862 thirteen northern governors met in altoona pennsylvania at the loyal war governors conference to discuss the proclamation and union war effort. in the end the state executives fully supported the presidents proclamation and also suggested the removal of general george b. mcclellan as commander of the unions army of the potomac. images of america altoona by sr. anne francis pulling 2001 10.. for some time lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. he commented favorably on colonization in the emancipation proclamation but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. as frederick douglass observed lincoln was the first great man that i talked with in the united states freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself of the difference of color. life and times of frederick douglass by frederick douglass 1895. after union victories at gettysburg vicksburg and chattanooga in 1863 victory seemed at hand and lincoln promoted ulysses s. grant generalinchief march 12 1864. when the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates lincoln supported grants strategy of wearing down lees confederate army at the cost of heavy union casualties. with an election looming he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. at the convention the republican party selected andrew johnson a war democrat from the southern state of tennessee as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. they ran on the new union party ticket uniting republicans and war democrats.. lincoln in top hat with allan pinkerton and gen. john alexander mcclernand at antietam.. nevertheless republicans across the country feared that lincoln would be defeated. acknowledging this fear lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that if he should lose the election he would nonetheless defeat the confederacy by an allout military effort before turning over the white house mark grimsley and brooks d simpson eds. the collapse of the confederacy 2001 p 80. lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.. while the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war a failure their candidate general george b. mcclellan supported the war and repudiated the platform.. lincoln provided grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to support grant and win local support for the war effort. shermans capture of atlanta in september ended defeatist jitters the democratic party was deeply split with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln the union party was united and energized and lincoln was easily reelected in a landslide. he won all but two states capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.. on march 4 1865 lincoln delivered his second inaugural address his favorite of all his speeches. at this time a victory over the rebels was at hand slavery was dead and lincoln was looking to the future.. running the machine. an 1864 cartoon featuring lincoln william fessenden edwin stanton william seward and gideon welles takes a swing at the lincoln administration. the war was a source of constant frustration for the president and occupied nearly all of his time. he had a contentious relationship with general mcclellan who became generalinchief of all the union armies in the wake of the embarrassing union defeat at the first battle of bull run and after the retirement of winfield scott in late 1861. despite his inexperience in military affairs lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. his priorities were twofold to ensure that washington d.c. was well defended and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the northern public and press. mcclellan a youthful west point graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service took a more cautious approach. he took several months to plan and execute his peninsula campaign with the objective of capturing richmond by moving the army of the potomac by boat to the peninsula between the james and york rivers. mcclellans delay irritated lincoln as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend washington d.c. lincoln insisted on holding some of mcclellans troops to defend the capital a decision mcclellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the peninsula campaign.. mcclellan a lifelong democrat who was temperamentally conservative was relieved as generalinchief after releasing his harrisons landing letter where he offered unsolicited political advice to lincoln urging caution in the war effort. mcclellans letter incensed radical republicans who successfully pressured lincoln to appoint john pope a republican as head of the new army of virginia. pope complied with lincolns strategic desire to move toward richmond from the north thus protecting the capital from attack. but pope was soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of 1862 forcing the army of the potomac to defend washington for a second time. in response to his failure pope was sent to minnesota to fight the sioux.. an 1864 mathew brady photo depicts president lincoln reading a book with his youngest son tad. panicked by lees invasion of maryland lincoln restored mcclellan to command of all forces around washington in time for the battle of antietam september 1862. the ensuing union victory enabled lincoln to release his emancipation proclamation but he relieved mcclellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed republican ambrose burnside to head the army of the potomac. burnside had promised to follow through on lincolns strategic vision for a strong offensive against lee and richmond. after burnside was stunningly defeated at fredericksburg joseph hooker was given the command despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders. joseph hooker biography hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville may 1863 and relieved of command early in the subsequent gettysburg campaign replaced by george meade.. after the union victory at gettysburg meades failure to pursue lee and months of inactivity for the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln to bring in a western general ulysses s. grant. grant already had a solid string of victories in the western theater including the battles of vicksburg and chattanooga. responding to criticism of grant lincoln was quoted as saying i cannot spare this man. he fights. grant waged his bloody overland campaign in 1864 with a strategy of a war of attrition characterized by high union losses at battles such as the wilderness and cold harbor but by proportionately higher confederate losses. his invasion campaign eventually bottled lee up in the siege of petersburg so that grant could take richmond and bring the war to a close in the spring of 1865.. lincoln authorized grant to target civilians and infrastructure hoping to destroy the souths morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. this allowed generals sherman and sheridan to destroy farms and towns in the shenandoah valley georgia and south carolina. the damage caused by shermans march to the sea through georgia totaled in excess of 100 million by shermans own estimate. see hofstadter richard the united states the history of a republic prenticehall 1967 p. 446.. lincoln had a starcrossed record as a military leader possessing a keen understanding of strategic points such as the mississippi river and the fortress city of vicksburg and the importance of defeating the enemys army rather than simply capturing cities. he had however limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863 when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in ulysses s. grant. only then could he insist on using african american troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.. throughout the war lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. he spent hours at the war department telegraph office reading dispatches from his generals. he visited battle sites frequently and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. during jubal anderson earlys raid on washington d.c. in 1864 lincoln had to be told to duck to avoid being shot while observing the battle.. reconstruction began during the war as lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the southern states and what to do with confederate leaders and the freed slaves. lincoln led the moderates regarding reconstructionist policy and was usually opposed by the radical republicans under thaddeus stevens in the house and charles sumner and benjamin wade in the senate though he cooperated with these men on most other issues. determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the south lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind union lines. his amnesty proclamation of december 8 1863 offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office had not mistreated union prisoners and would sign an oath of allegiance. ref critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. of special importance were tennessee where lincoln appointed andrew johnson as governor and louisiana where lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. the radicals thought this policy too lenient and passed their own plan the wadedavis bill in 1864. when lincoln pocketvetoed the bill the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from louisiana arkansas and tennessee. donald 1995 ch. 20. on april 9 1865 lee surrendered at appomattox court house in virginia and the war was effectively over. the other rebel armies surrendered soon after and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare. lincoln went to richmond to make a public gesture of sitting at jefferson daviss own desk symbolically saying to the nation that the president of the united states held authority over the entire land. he was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirers quote i know i am free for i have seen the face of father abraham and have felt him. when a general asked lincoln how the defeated confederates should be treated lincoln replied let em up easy. donald 1995 576 580 president lincoln enters richmond 1865 eyewitness to history www.eywitnesstohistory.com 2000.. one of the last photographs of lincoln likely taken between february and april 1865. lincolns powerful rhetoric defined the issues of the war for the nation the world and posterity. his extraordinary command of the english language was evidenced in the gettysburg address a speech dedicating the cemetery at gettysburg that he delivered on november 19 1863. the speech defied lincolns own prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here. lincolns second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted. in these speeches lincoln articulated better than anyone else the rationale behind the union cause.. in recent years historians have stressed lincolns use of and redefinition of republican values. as early as the 1850s a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the constitution lincoln shifted emphasis to the declaration of independence as the foundation of american political valueswhat he called the sheet anchor of republicanism. jaffa 2000 p. 399 the declarations emphasis on freedom and equality for all rather than the constitutions tolerance of slavers shifted the debate. as diggins concludes regarding the highly influential cooper union speech lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself. john patrick diggins the lost soul of american

p. 215 says lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism. see also mcpherson 1992 pp.6164. nevertheless in 1861 lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms the constitution was a contract and

it was born not in 1789 but in 1776 conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. he declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth. by emphasizing the centrality of the nation he rebuffed the claims of state sovereignty. while some critics say lincoln moved too far and too fast h.l. mencken said it is difficult to imagine anything more untrue. the union soldiers in the battle actually fought against selfdetermination it was the confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves. mencken did not mention the right of selfdetermination rights for blacks. they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked a new founding of the nation. wills 1992 p. 39.. during the civil war lincoln appropriated powers no previous president had wielded he used his war powers to proclaim a blockade suspended the writ of habeas corpus spent money without congressional authorization and imprisoned 18000 suspected confederate sympathizers without trial. nearly all of his actions although vehemently denounced by the copperheads were subsequently upheld by congress and the courts.. lincoln believed in the whig theory of the presidency which left congress to write the laws while he signed them vetoing only those bills that threatened his war powers. thus he signed the homestead act in 1862 making millions of acres of governmentheld land in the west available for purchase at very low cost. the morrill landgrant colleges act also signed in 1862 provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state. the pacific railway acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the united states first transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869. other important

cabinetlevel department until 1889.. the legal tender act of 1862 established the united states note the first paper currency in united states history. this was done to increase the money supply to

dying of his wounds soon after.. an army surgeon doctor charles leale initially assessed lincolns wound as mortal. the president was taken across the street from the theater to the petersen house

known for appointing political rivals to high positions in his cabinet to keep in line all factions of his party and to let them battle each other and not combine against lincoln. historians agree that except for simon cameron it was a highly effective group.. abraham lincolns official white house portrait. lincoln appointed the following justices to the supreme court of the united states. in march 1860 in a speech in new haven connecticut lincoln said with respect to slavery whenever this question shall be settled it must be settled on some philosophical basis. no policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained. the philosophical basis for lincolns beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that lincoln be examined seriously as a man of ideas. lincoln was a strong supporter of the american whig version of liberal capitalism who more than most politicians of the time was able to express his ideas within the context of nineteenth century religious beliefs. guelzo pg. 1819. there were few people who strongly or directly influenced lincolns moral and intellectual development and perspectives. there was no teacher mentor church leader community leader or peer that lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. lacking a formal education lincolns personal philosophy was shaped by an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning. it was lincolns reading rather than his relationships that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs. guelzo pg. 20. miller pg. 5759 lincolns reading and study of the bible was an integral part of his intellectual roots.. lincoln did even as a boy largely reject organized religion but the calvinistic doctrine of necessity would remain a factor throughout his life. in 1846 lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as that the human mind is impelled to action or held in rest by some power over which the mind itself has no control. donald pg. 15. the quote came from a letter to the public in which lincoln was denying charges by a political opponent that he was a religious scoffer. in april 1864 in justifying his actions in regard to emancipation lincoln wrote i claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me. now at the end of three years struggle the nations condition is not what either party or any man devised or expected. god alone can claim it. donald pg. 514. as lincoln matured and especially during his term as president the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. on a personal level the death of his son willie in february 1862 may have caused lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace. wilson pg. 251254 after willies death in the summer or early fall of 1862 lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why from a divine standpoint the severity of the war was necessary. lincolns religious skepticism was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the lockean enlightenment and classical liberalism especially economic liberalism. guelzo pg. 20 consistent with the common practice of the whig party lincoln would often use the declaration of independence as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies. guelzo pg.194 in a february 22 1861 speech at independence hall in philadelphia lincoln said. he found in the declaration justification for whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the nativist platform of the know nothings. in claiming that all men were created free lincoln and the whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement expanded education territory to grow and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population. guelzo pg.194195. it was the declaration of independence rather than the bible that lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. he saw the declaration as more than a political document. to him as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders it was foremost a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation. miller pg. 297. while lincoln is usually portrayed bearded he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11yearold grace bedell. lincolns death made the president a martyr to many. repeated polls of historians have ranked lincoln as among the greatest presidents in u.s. history often appearing in the first position. among contemporary admirers lincoln is usually seen as personifying classical values of honesty and integrity as well as respect for individual and minority rights and human freedom in general.. many american organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image with interests ranging from the gay rightssupporting log cabin republicans to the insurance corporation lincoln national corporation. the lincoln automobile is also named after him. the ballistic missile submarine abraham lincoln ssbn602 and the aircraft carrier abraham lincoln cvn72 were named in his honor. also the liberty ship ss nancy hanks was named to honor his mother. during the spanish civil war the american faction of the international brigades named themselves the abraham lincoln brigade after lincoln.. lincoln has been memorialized in many city names notably the capital of nebraska. lincoln illinois is the only city to be named

opponent of the expansion of slavery in the united states in his short autobiography written for the 1860 presidential campaign lincoln would describe his protest in the illinois legislature as one that briefly defined his position on the slavery question and so far as it goes it was then the same that it is now. this was in reference to the antiexpansion sentiments he had then expressed. doris kearns goodwin team of rivals the political genius of abraham lincoln 2005 p. 91. holzer pg. 232. writing of the cooper union speech holzer notes cooper union proved a unique confluence of political culture rhetorical opportunity technological innovation and human genius and it brought abraham lincoln to the center stage of american politics at precisely the right time and place and with precisely the right message that slavery was wrong and ought to be confined to the areas where it already existed and placed on the course of ultimate extinction... . lincoln won the republican party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year. during his term he helped preserve the united states by leading the defeat of the secessionist confederate states of america in the american civil war. he introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery issuing his emancipation proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the thirteenth amendment to the constitution in 1865.. lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort especially the selection of top generals including ulysses s. grant. historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the republican party well bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. lincoln successfully defused a war scare with the united kingdom in 1861. under his leadership the union took control of the border slave states at the start of the war. additionally he managed his own reelection in the 1864 presidential election.. opponents of the war also known as copperheads criticized him for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. conversely the radical republicans an abolitionist faction of the republican party criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. even with these problems lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches his gettysburg address is but one example of this. at the close of the war lincoln held a moderate view of reconstruction seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. his assassination in 1865 was the first presidential assassination in u.s. history and made him a martyr for the ideal of national unity.. scholars now rank lincoln among the top three u.s. presidents with the majority of those surveyed placing him first. he is noted for his lasting influence on u.s. politics including a redefinition of republicanism. as diggins explains lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself. john patrick diggins the lost soul of american politics virtue selfinterest and the foundations of liberalism 1986 p. 307. foner 1970 p. 215 noted that

church over the issue of slavery. though lincoln was exposed to his parents antislavery sentiment from a very young age he never joined their church or any other church for that matter. as a youth he had little use for religion. life of abraham lincoln colonel ward h. lamon 1872 portions reprinted in chapter viii abraham lincoln deist and admirer of thomas paine from the book religious beliefs of our presidents by franklin steiner 1936. lincoln was just seven years old when in 1816 the family was forced to make a new start in perry county now in spencer county indiana. he later noted that this move was partly on account of slavery and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in kentucky unlike land in the northwest territory kentucky never had a proper u.s. survey and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property. lincoln was only nine when his mother then thirtyfour years old died of milk sickness. soon afterwards his father remarried to sarah bush johnston. sarah lincoln raised young lincoln like one of her own children. years later she compared lincoln to her own son saying both were good boys but i must say both now being dead that abe was the best boy i ever saw or ever expect to see. lincoln was affectionate toward his stepmother whom he would call mother for the rest of his life but he was distant from his father. donald 1995 pp. 28 152.. in 1830 after more economic and landtitle difficulties in indiana the family settled on public land ref in macon county illinois. some scholars believe that it was his fathers repeated landtitle difficulties and ensuing financial hardships that led young lincoln to study law. the following winter was desolate and especially brutal and the family considered moving back to indiana. the following year when his father relocated the family to a new homestead in coles county illinois twentytwoyearold lincoln struck out on his own canoeing down the sangamon river to the village of new salem in sangamon county. later that year hired by new salem businessman denton offutt and accompanied by friends he took goods from new salem to new orleans via flatboat on the sangamon illinois and mississippi

illinois general assembly as a member of the whig party. he ran eighth in a field of 13 candidates. the centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the sangamon river. he believed that this would attract steamboat traffic which would allow the sparsely populated poorer areas along the river to flourish.. he was elected captain of an illinois militia company drawn from new salem during the black hawk war and later wrote that he had not had any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction. thomas 1952 3234 basler 1946 p. 551 though he never saw

of anonymous letters published in 1842 in the sangamon journal mocking state auditor and prominent democrat james shields. shields would later become a u.s. senator but when he learned that it was lincoln who had been writing the barbs he challenged him to a duel. as shields was the challenger lincoln was granted the right to choose the weapon and specified cavalry broad swords of the largest size. much taller and with long arms this gave him an overwhelming advantage over his opponent however the duel was called off at the last minute. beveridge 1928 1349. lincoln had been practicing with

in 1846. as a freshman house member he was not a particularly powerful or influential figure. he spoke out against the mexicanamerican war which he attributed to president polks desire for military glory that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood. he also challenged the presidents claims regarding the texas boundary and offered spot resolutions demanding to know on what spot on us soil that blood was first spilt. congressional globe 30th session 1848 pp.9395 in january of 1848 he was among the 82 whigs who defeated 81 democrats in a procedural vote on an amendment to send a

has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men women and children and lay waste and pillage the land of the just. two weeks later president polk sent a peace treaty to congress. while no one in washington paid any attention to lincoln the democrats orchestrated angry outbursts from across his district where the war was popular and many had volunteered. in morgan county resolutions were adopted in fervent support of the war and in wrathful denunciation of the treasonable assaults of guerrillas at home party demagogues slanderers of the president defenders of the butchery at the alamo traducers of the heroism at san jacinto. abe lincoln resource page. warned by his law partner william herndon that the damage was mounting and irreparable lincoln decided not to run for reelection. in fact in 1848 he campaigned vigorously for zachary taylor the successful general whose atrocities he had denounced in january. regardless his statements were not easily forgotten and would haunt him during the civil war. these statements were also held against him when he applied for a position in the new taylor administration. instead taylors people offered lincoln various positions in the remote oregon territory primarily the governorship. acceptance of this offer would have ended his career in the rapidly growing state of illinois so lincoln declined the position. returning to springfield lincoln gave up politics for several years and turned his energies to his law practice. during this time he made many trips on horseback between various counties courthouses. beveridge 1928 1 42833 donald 1995 p. 14043.. in the 1920s historical markers were placed at the county lines along the route lincoln traveled in the eight judicial district. this example is on the border of piatt and dewitt counties. by the mid1850s lincolns caseload focused largely on the competing transportation interests of river barges and railroads. in one prominent 1851 case he represented the alton sangamon railroad in a dispute with a shareholder james a. barret. barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to the railroad on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest that the newer route proposed by alton sangamon was superior and less expensive and that accordingly the corporation had a right to sue barret for his delinquent payment. he won this case and the decision by the illinois supreme court was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the united states. donald 1995 ch. 6.. possibly the most notable criminal trial of lincolns career as a lawyer came in 1858 when he defended william duff armstrong who has been charged with murder. the case became famous for lincolns use of judicial noticea rare tactic at that timeto show that an eyewitness had lied on the stand. after the witness testified to having seen the crime by moonlight lincoln produced a farmers almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle that it could not have provided enough illumination to see anything clearly. based almost entirely on this evidence armstrong was acquitted. donald 1995 15051. lincoln was involved in more than 5100 cases in illinois alone during his 23year legal career. though many of these cases involved little more than filing a writ others were more substantial and quite involved. lincoln and his partners appeared before the illinois state supreme court more than 400 times. during one trial lincolns voir dire included a question to prospective jurors as to whether they were acquainted with counsel for the other side. when a few of them turned out to know the other lawyer the judge interrupted saying mr. lincoln you are wasting the time of the court. the fact that a prospective juror knows your opponent does not disqualify him.. no your honor i understand that lincoln answered. im afraid that some of them might not know him which would place me at a disadvantage.. lincoln returned to politics in response to the kansasnebraska act 1854 which expressly repealed the limits on slaverys extent as determined by the missouri compromise 1820. illinois democrat stephen a. douglas the most powerful man in the senate proposed popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse and incorporated it into the kansasnebraska act. douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory rather than have such a decision imposed on them by congress. donald 1995 ch. 7.. in a speech against the act on october 16 1854 delivered in peoria lincoln first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day. drawing on remnants of the old whig free soil liberty and democratic parties he was instrumental in forming the new republican party. in a stirring campaign the republicans carried illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. lincoln was the obvious choice but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an exdemocrat lyman trumbull.. in 185758 douglas broke with president buchanan leading to a fight for control of the democratic party. some eastern republicans even favored the reelection of douglas in 1858 since he had led the opposition to the lecompton constitution which would have admitted kansas as a slave state. accepting the republican nomination for senate in 1858 lincoln delivered his famous speech a house divided against itself cannot stand.mark 325 i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided. it will become all one thing or all the other. a house divided against itself cannot stand june 1858 the speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate and rallied republicans across the north.. the 1858 campaign featured the lincolndouglas debates a nationally famous contest on slavery. lincoln warned that the slave power was threatening the values of republicanism while douglas emphasized the supremacy of democracy as set forth in his freeport doctrine which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not. though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature reelected douglas to the senate. nevertheless lincolns eloquence transformed him into a national political star.. during the debates of 1858 the issue of race was often discussed. during a time period when few believed in racial egalitarianism stephen douglas informed the crowds if you desire negro citizenship if you desire them to vote on an equality

countered that he was not in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races. fourth debate with stephen a. douglas at charleston illinois september 18 1858 his opposition to slavery was opposition to the slave power though this would change during the course of the civil war. donald 1995 ch. 8.. on may 910 1860 the illinois republican state

entering the presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog lincoln was eventually chosen as the republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. his expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals william h. seward and salmon p. chase. his western origins also appealed to the newer states other contenders especially those with more governmental experience had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states while lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the west. most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party as the slave power tightened its grasp on the national government. yet despite his southern connections his inlaws owned slaves lincoln misunderstood the depth of the revolution underway in the south and the emergence of southern nationalism. throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession. gabor s. boritt and the war came? abraham lincoln and the question of individual responsibility why the civil war came ed by boritt 1996 pp 330.. throughout the election lincoln did not campaign or give speeches. this was handled by the state and county republican organizations who used the latest techniques to sustain party enthusiasm and thus obtain high turnout. there was little effort to convert nonrepublicans and there was virtually no campaigning in the south except for a few border cities such as st. louis missouri and wheeling virginia indeed the party did not even run a slate in most of the south. in the north there were thousands of republican speakers tons of campaign posters and leaflets and thousands of newspaper editorials. these focused first on the party platform and second on lincolns life story making the most of his boyhood poverty his pioneer background his native genius and his rise from obscurity. his nicknames honest abe and the railsplitter were exploited to the full. the goal was to emphasize the superior power of free labor whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. thomas 1952 p 216 reinhard h. luthin the first lincoln campaign 1944 nevins vol 4. on november 6 1860 lincoln was elected as the 16th president of the united states beating democrat stephen a. douglas john c. breckinridge of the southern democrats and john bell of the new constitutional union party. he was the first republican president winning entirely on the strength of his support in the north he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the south and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other southern states. lincoln gained 1865908 votes 39.9 of the total for 180 electoral votes douglas 1380202 29.5 for 12 electoral votes breckenridge 848019 18.1 for 72 electoral votes and bell 590901 12.5 for 39 electoral votes. there were fusion tickets in some states but even if his opponents had combined in every state lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election.. as lincolns election became more likely secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the union. south carolina took the lead followed by six other cottongrowing states in the deep south. the upper south delaware maryland virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri and arkansas listened to and rejected the secessionist appeal. they decided to stay in the union though they warned lincoln that they would not support an invasion through their territory. the seven confederate states seceded before lincoln took office declaring themselves to be a new nation the confederate states of america. president buchanan and presidentelect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy.. presidentelect lincoln evaded possible assassins in baltimore and on february 23 1861 arrived in disguise in washington d.c. at his inauguration on march 4 1861 the german american turners formed lincolns bodyguard and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present ready to protect the capital from confederate invasion and local insurrection.. photograph showing the march 4 1861 inauguration of abraham lincoln in front of united states capitol.. in his first inaugural address lincoln declared i hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution the union of these states is perpetual. perpetuity is implied if not expressed in the fundamental law of all national governments arguing further that the purpose of the united states constitution was to form a more perfect union than the articles of confederation which were explicitly perpetual thus the constitution too was perpetual. he asked rhetorically that even were the constitution a simple contract would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?. also in his inaugural address in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war lincoln supported the pending corwin amendment to the constitution which had already passed congress. this amendment which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it existed was designed to appeal not to the confederacy but to the critical border states. at the same time lincoln adamantly opposed the crittenden compromise which would have permitted slavery in the territories. despite support for the crittenden compromise among some prominent republicans including william seward lincoln denounced it saying that it would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people tribe and state owning a foot of land between here and tierra del fuego.. by the time lincoln took office the confederacy was an established fact and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the union on any terms. no compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. lincoln might have allowed the southern states to secede and some republicans recommended that. however conservative democratic nationalists such as jeremiah s. black joseph holt and edwin m. stanton had taken control of buchanans cabinet around january 1 1861 and refused to accept secession. lincoln and nearly every republican leader adopted this position by march 1861 the union could not be dismantled. however as a strict follower of the constitution lincoln refused to take any action against the south unless the unionists themselves were attacked first. this finally happened in april 1861.. historian allan nevins argues that lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the union hold government property and still avoid war. he temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis overestimated the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and border states and misunderstood the conditional support of unionists in the border states. allan nevins the improvised war 18611862 1959 p 29. in april 1861 after union troops at fort sumter were fired upon and forced to surrender lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75000 troops to recapture forts protect the capital and preserve the union which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. virginia which had repeatedly warned lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state responded by seceding along with north carolina tennessee and arkansas.. the slave states of missouri kentucky maryland and delaware did not secede and lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there promising not to interfere with slavery. after the fighting started he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas especially in maryland and held in military prisons without trial. over 18000 were arrested though none were executed. one clement vallandigham was exiled but all of the remainder were released usually after two or three months see ex parte merryman.. lincoln met with his cabinet for the first reading of the emancipation proclamation draft on july 22 1862. lr edwin m. stanton salmon p. chase abraham lincoln gideon welles caleb b. smith william h. seward montgomery blair and edward bates. in july 1862 congress moved to free the slaves by passing the second confiscation act. the goal was to weaken the rebellion which was led and controlled by slave owners. while it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery the thirteenth amendment did that the act showed that lincoln had the support of congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. this new law was implemented with lincolns emancipation proclamation.. lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the united states. in 1861 1862 however he made it clear that the north was fighting the war to preserve the union not to abolish slavery. freeing the slaves became in late 1862 a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. abolitionists criticized lincoln for his sluggishness over slavery per se but on august 22 1862 lincoln explained. the emancipation proclamation announced on september 22 and put into effect on january 1 1863 freed slaves in territories not under union control. as union armies advanced south more slaves were liberated until all of them in confederate hands over three million were freed. lincoln later said i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper. the proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the thirteenth amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation. lincoln addressed the issue of his consistency in an 1864 letter to albert g. hodges. letter to albert g. hodges april 4 1864. in september 1862 thirteen northern governors met in altoona pennsylvania at the loyal war governors conference to discuss the proclamation and union war effort. in the end the state executives fully supported the presidents proclamation and also suggested the removal of general george b. mcclellan as commander of the unions army of the potomac. images of america altoona by sr. anne francis pulling 2001 10.. for some time lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. he commented favorably on colonization in the emancipation proclamation but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. as frederick douglass observed lincoln was the first great man that i talked with in the united states freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself of the difference of color. life and times of frederick douglass by frederick douglass 1895. after union victories at gettysburg vicksburg and chattanooga in 1863 victory seemed at hand and lincoln promoted ulysses s. grant generalinchief march 12 1864. when the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates lincoln supported grants strategy of wearing down lees confederate army at the cost of heavy union casualties. with an election looming he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. at the convention the republican party selected andrew johnson a war democrat from the southern state of tennessee as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. they ran on the new union party ticket uniting republicans and war democrats.. lincoln in top hat with allan pinkerton and gen. john alexander mcclernand at antietam.. nevertheless republicans across the country feared that lincoln would be defeated. acknowledging this fear lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that if he should lose the election he would nonetheless defeat the confederacy by an allout military effort before turning over the white house mark grimsley and brooks d simpson eds. the collapse of the confederacy 2001 p 80. lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.. while the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war a failure their candidate general george b. mcclellan supported the war and repudiated the platform.. lincoln provided grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to support grant and win local support for the war effort. shermans capture of atlanta in september ended defeatist jitters the democratic party was deeply split with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln the union party was united and energized and lincoln was easily reelected in a landslide. he won all but two states capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.. on march 4 1865 lincoln delivered his second inaugural address his favorite of all his speeches. at this time a victory over the rebels was at hand slavery was dead and lincoln was looking to the future.. running the machine. an 1864 cartoon featuring lincoln william fessenden edwin stanton william seward and gideon welles takes a swing at the lincoln administration. the war was a source of constant frustration for the president and occupied nearly all of his time. he had a contentious relationship with general mcclellan who became generalinchief of all the union armies in the wake of the embarrassing union defeat at the first battle of bull run and after the retirement of winfield scott in late 1861. despite his inexperience in military affairs lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. his priorities were twofold to ensure that washington d.c. was well defended and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the northern public and press. mcclellan a youthful west point graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service took a more cautious approach. he took several months to plan and execute his peninsula campaign with the objective of capturing richmond by moving the army of the potomac by boat to the peninsula between the james and york rivers. mcclellans delay irritated lincoln as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend washington d.c. lincoln insisted on holding some of mcclellans troops to defend the capital a decision mcclellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the peninsula campaign.. mcclellan a lifelong democrat who was temperamentally conservative was relieved as generalinchief after releasing his harrisons landing letter where he offered unsolicited political advice to lincoln urging caution in the war effort. mcclellans letter incensed radical republicans who successfully pressured lincoln to appoint john pope a republican as head of the new army of virginia. pope complied with lincolns strategic desire to move toward richmond from the north thus protecting the capital from attack. but pope was soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of 1862 forcing the army of the potomac to defend washington for a second time. in response to his failure pope was sent to minnesota to fight the sioux.. an 1864 mathew brady photo depicts president lincoln reading a book with his youngest son tad. panicked by lees invasion of maryland lincoln restored mcclellan to command of all forces around washington in time for the battle of antietam september 1862. the ensuing union victory enabled lincoln to release his emancipation proclamation but he relieved mcclellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed republican ambrose burnside to head the army of the potomac. burnside had promised to follow through on lincolns strategic vision for a strong offensive against lee and richmond. after burnside was stunningly defeated at fredericksburg joseph hooker was given the command despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders. joseph hooker biography hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville may 1863 and relieved of command early in the subsequent gettysburg campaign replaced by george meade.. after the union victory at gettysburg meades failure to pursue lee and months of inactivity for the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln to bring in a western general ulysses s. grant. grant already had a solid string of victories in the western theater including the battles of vicksburg and chattanooga. responding to criticism of grant lincoln was quoted as saying i cannot spare this man. he fights. grant waged his bloody overland campaign in 1864 with a strategy of a war of attrition characterized by high union losses at battles such as the wilderness and cold harbor but by proportionately higher confederate losses. his invasion campaign eventually bottled lee up in the siege of petersburg so that grant could take richmond and bring the war to a close in the spring of 1865.. lincoln authorized grant to target civilians and infrastructure hoping to destroy the souths morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. this allowed generals sherman and sheridan to destroy farms and towns in the shenandoah valley georgia and south carolina. the damage caused by shermans march to the sea through georgia totaled in excess of 100 million by shermans own estimate. see hofstadter richard the united states the history of a republic prenticehall 1967 p. 446.. lincoln had a starcrossed record as a military leader possessing a keen understanding of strategic points such as the mississippi river and the fortress city of vicksburg and the importance of defeating the enemys army rather than simply capturing cities. he had however limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863 when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in ulysses s. grant. only then could he insist on using african american troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.. throughout the war lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. he spent hours at the war department telegraph office reading dispatches from his generals. he visited battle sites frequently and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. during jubal anderson earlys raid on washington d.c. in 1864 lincoln had to be told to duck to avoid being shot while observing the battle.. reconstruction began during the war as lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the southern states and what to do with confederate leaders and the freed slaves. lincoln led the moderates regarding reconstructionist policy and was usually opposed by the radical republicans under thaddeus stevens in the house and charles sumner and benjamin wade in the senate though he cooperated with these men on most other issues. determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the south lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind union lines. his amnesty proclamation of december 8 1863 offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office had not mistreated union prisoners and would sign an oath of allegiance. ref critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. of special importance were tennessee where lincoln appointed andrew johnson as governor and louisiana where lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. the radicals thought this policy too lenient and passed their own plan the wadedavis bill in 1864. when lincoln pocketvetoed the bill the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from louisiana arkansas and tennessee. donald 1995 ch. 20. on april 9 1865 lee surrendered at appomattox court house in virginia and the war was effectively over. the other rebel armies surrendered soon after and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare. lincoln went to richmond to make a public gesture of sitting at jefferson daviss own desk symbolically saying to the nation that the president of the united states held authority over the entire land. he was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirers quote i know i am free for i have seen the face of father abraham and have felt him. when a general asked lincoln how the defeated confederates should be treated lincoln replied let em up easy. donald 1995 576 580 president lincoln enters richmond 1865 eyewitness to history www.eywitnesstohistory.com 2000.. one of the last photographs of lincoln likely taken between february and april 1865. lincolns powerful rhetoric defined the issues of the war for the nation the world and posterity. his extraordinary command of the english language was evidenced in the gettysburg address a speech dedicating the cemetery at gettysburg that he delivered on november 19 1863. the speech defied lincolns own prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here. lincolns second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted. in these speeches lincoln articulated better than anyone else the rationale behind the union cause.. in recent years historians have stressed lincolns use of and redefinition of republican values. as early as the 1850s a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the constitution lincoln shifted emphasis to the declaration of independence as the foundation of american political valueswhat he called the sheet anchor of republicanism. jaffa 2000 p. 399 the declarations emphasis on freedom and equality for all rather than the constitutions tolerance of slavers shifted the debate. as diggins concludes regarding the highly influential cooper union speech lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself. john patrick diggins the lost soul of american politics virtue selfinterest and the foundations of liberalism 1986 p. 307. his position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism rather than its legalisms. foner 1970 p. 215 says lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism. see also mcpherson 1992 pp.6164. nevertheless in 1861 lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms the constitution was a contract and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state. jaffa 2000 p. 263 that duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in reconstruction.. lincolns second inauguration on march 4 1865. in the photo lincolns assassin john wilkes booth can be seen in the crowd at the top and accomplices david herold lewis powell george atzerodt john surratt and edmund spangler in the bottom crowd. in his gettysburg address lincoln redefined the american nation arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776 conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. he declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth. by emphasizing the centrality of the nation he rebuffed the claims of state sovereignty. while some critics say lincoln moved too far and too fast h.l. mencken said it is difficult to imagine anything more untrue. the union soldiers in the battle actually fought against selfdetermination it was the confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves. mencken did not mention the right of selfdetermination rights for blacks. they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked a new founding of the nation. wills 1992 p. 39.. during the civil war lincoln appropriated powers no previous president had wielded he used his war powers to proclaim a blockade suspended the writ of habeas corpus spent money without congressional authorization and imprisoned 18000 suspected confederate sympathizers without trial. nearly all of his actions although vehemently denounced by the copperheads were subsequently upheld by congress and the courts.. lincoln believed in the whig theory of the presidency which left congress to write the laws while he signed them vetoing only those bills that threatened his war powers. thus he signed the homestead act in 1862 making millions of acres of governmentheld land in the west available for purchase at very low cost. the morrill landgrant colleges act also signed in 1862 provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state. the pacific railway acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the united states first transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869. other important legislation involved economic matters including the first income tax and higher tariffs. also included was the creation of the system of national banks by the national banking acts of 1863 1864 and 1865 which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system. congress created and lincoln approved the department of agriculture in 1862 although that institution would not become a cabinetlevel department until 1889.. the legal tender act of 1862 established the united states note the first paper currency in united states history. this was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.. during the war lincolns treasury department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied souththe most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.. in 1862 lincoln sent a senior general john pope to put down the sioux uprising in minnesota. presented with 303 death warrants for convicted santee dakota who had massacred innocent farmers lincoln affirmed 39 of these for execution one was later reprieved.. the assassination of abraham lincoln. from left to right henry rathbone clara harris mary todd lincoln abraham lincoln and john wilkes

dying of his wounds soon after.. an army surgeon doctor charles leale initially assessed lincolns wound as mortal. the president was taken across the street from the theater to the petersen house where he lay in a coma for nine hours before he died. several physicians attended lincoln including u.s. army surgeon general joseph k. barnes of the army medical museum. using a probe barnes located some fragments of lincolns skull and the ball lodged 6 inches 15 cm inside his brain. lincoln never regained consciousness and was officially pronounced dead at 72210 a.m. april 15 1865 at the age of 56. there is some disagreement among historians as to stantons words after lincoln died. all agree that he began now he belongs to the... with some stating he said ages while others believe he said angels. after lincolns body was returned to the white house his body was prepared for his lying in repose in the east room. he was the first president to lie in state.. the army medical museum now named the national museum of health and medicine has retained in its collection several artifacts relating to the assassination. currently on display are the bullet that was fired from the derringer pistol the probe used by barnes pieces of lincolns skull and hair and the surgeons cuff stained with lincolns blood.. lincolns funeral train carried his remains as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son william 1654 miles 2661 km to illinois . lincolns body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to illinois. while much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the united states copperheads celebrated the death of a man they considered an unconstitutional tyrant. the lincoln tomb in oak ridge cemetery in springfield is 177 feet 54 m tall and by 1874 was surmounted with several bronze statues of lincoln. to prevent repeated attempts to steal lincolns body and hold it for ransom robert todd lincoln had lincoln exhumed and reinterred in concrete several feet thick in 1901.. with over 120 photographs taken of him lincoln was the most photographed man in the united states up to the time he was assassinated.. lincoln was known for appointing political rivals to high positions in his cabinet to keep in line all factions of his party and to let them battle each other and not combine against lincoln. historians agree that except for simon cameron it was a highly effective group.. abraham lincolns official white house portrait. lincoln appointed the following justices to the supreme court of the united states. in march 1860 in a speech in new haven connecticut lincoln said with respect to slavery whenever this question shall be settled it must be settled on some philosophical basis. no policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained. the philosophical basis for lincolns beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that lincoln be examined seriously as a man of ideas. lincoln was a strong supporter of the american whig version of liberal capitalism who more than most politicians of the time was able to express his ideas within the context of nineteenth century religious beliefs. guelzo pg. 1819. there were few people who strongly or directly influenced lincolns moral and intellectual development and perspectives. there was no teacher mentor church leader community leader or peer that lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. lacking a formal education lincolns personal philosophy was shaped by an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning. it was lincolns reading rather than his relationships that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs. guelzo pg. 20. miller pg. 5759 lincolns reading and study of the bible was an integral part of his intellectual roots.. lincoln did even as a boy largely reject organized religion but the calvinistic doctrine of necessity would remain a factor throughout his life. in 1846 lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as that the human mind is impelled to action or held in rest by some power over which the mind itself has no control. donald pg. 15. the quote came from a letter to the public in which lincoln was denying charges by a political opponent that he was a religious scoffer. in april 1864 in justifying his actions in regard to emancipation lincoln wrote i claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me. now at the end of three years struggle the nations condition is not what either party or any man devised or expected. god alone can claim it. donald pg. 514. as lincoln matured and especially during his term as president the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. on a personal level the death of his son willie in february 1862 may have caused lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace. wilson pg. 251254 after willies death in the summer or early fall of 1862 lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why from a divine standpoint the severity of the war was necessary. lincolns religious skepticism was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the lockean enlightenment and classical liberalism especially economic liberalism. guelzo pg. 20 consistent with the common practice of the whig party lincoln would often use the declaration of independence as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies. guelzo pg.194 in a february 22 1861 speech at independence hall in philadelphia lincoln said. he found in the declaration justification for whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the nativist platform of the know nothings. in claiming that all men were created free lincoln and the whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement expanded education territory to grow and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population. guelzo pg.194195. it was the declaration of independence rather than the bible that lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. he saw the declaration as more than a political document. to him as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders it was foremost a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation. miller pg. 297. while lincoln is usually portrayed bearded he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11yearold grace bedell. lincolns death made the president a martyr to many. repeated polls of historians have ranked lincoln as among the greatest presidents in u.s. history often appearing in the first position. among contemporary admirers lincoln is usually seen as personifying classical values of honesty and integrity as well as respect for individual and minority rights and human freedom in general.. many american organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image with interests ranging from the gay rightssupporting log cabin republicans to the insurance corporation lincoln national corporation. the lincoln automobile is also named after him. the ballistic missile submarine abraham lincoln ssbn602 and the aircraft carrier abraham lincoln cvn72 were named in his honor. also the liberty ship ss nancy hanks was named to honor his mother. during the spanish civil war the american faction of the international brigades named themselves the abraham lincoln brigade after lincoln.. lincoln has been memorialized in many city names notably the capital of nebraska. lincoln illinois is the only city to be named for abraham lincoln before he became president. lincolns name and image appear in numerous places. these include the lincoln memorial in washington d.c. the u.s. lincoln 5 bill and the lincoln cent

              "3     abraham lincoln. abraham lincoln february 12 1809 april 15 1865 was the sixteenth president of the united states serving from march 4 1861 until his assassination. as an outspoken opponent of the expansion of slavery in the united states in his short autobiography written for the 1860 presidential campaign lincoln would describe his protest in the illinois legislature as one that briefly defined his position on the slavery question and so far as it goes it was then the same that it is now. this was in reference to the antiexpansion sentiments he had then expressed. doris kearns goodwin team of rivals the political genius of abraham lincoln 2005 p. 91. holzer pg. 232. writing of the cooper union speech holzer notes cooper union proved a unique confluence of political culture rhetorical opportunity technological innovation and human genius and it brought abraham lincoln to the center stage of american politics at precisely the right time and place and with precisely the right message that slavery was wrong and ought to be confined to the areas where it already existed and placed on the course of ultimate extinction... . lincoln won the republican party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year. during his term he helped preserve the united states by leading the defeat of the secessionist confederate states of america in the american civil war. he introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery issuing his emancipation proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the thirteenth amendment to the constitution in 1865.. lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort especially the selection of top generals including ulysses s. grant. historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the republican party well bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. lincoln successfully defused a war scare with the united kingdom in 1861. under his leadership the union took control of the border slave states at the start of the war. additionally he managed his own reelection in the 1864 presidential election.. opponents of the war also known as copperheads criticized him for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. conversely the radical republicans an abolitionist faction of the republican party criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. even with these problems lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches his gettysburg address is but one example of this. at the close of the war lincoln held a moderate view of reconstruction seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. his assassination in 1865 was the first presidential assassination in u.s. history and made him a martyr for the ideal of national unity.. scholars now rank lincoln among the top three u.s. presidents with the majority of those surveyed placing him first. he is noted for his lasting influence on u.s. politics including a redefinition of republicanism. as diggins explains lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself. john patrick diggins the lost soul of american politics virtue selfinterest and the foundations of liberalism 1986 p. 307. foner 1970 p. 215 noted that lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism. jaffa 2000 p. 399 stresses lincolns emphasis on the declaration of independence as what lincoln called the sheet anchor of republicanism. see also mcpherson 1992 pp.6164.. abraham lincoln was born on february 12 1809 to thomas lincoln and nancy hanks two uneducated farmers. lincoln was born in a oneroom log cabin on the sinking spring farm in southeast hardin county kentucky now part of larue county. this area was at the time considered the frontier. the name abraham was chosen to commemorate his grandfather who was killed in an american indian raid in 1786. donald 1995 p 21 his elder sister sarah lincoln was born in 1807 a younger brother thomas jr died in infancy. it is sometimes debated whether lincoln had marfan syndrome an autosomal dominant disorder of the connective tissue characterized by long limbs and great physical stature. marfan syndrome introduction aug 1 2006. symbolic log cabin at abraham lincoln birthplace national historic site.. for some time thomas lincoln was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the kentucky back country. he had purchased the sinking spring farm in december of 1808 for 200 cash and assumption of a debt. the farm site is now preserved as part of abraham lincoln birthplace national historic site. the family belonged to a baptist church that had seceded from a larger church over the issue of slavery. though lincoln was exposed to his parents antislavery sentiment from a very young age he never joined their church or any other church for that matter. as a youth he had little use for religion. life of abraham lincoln colonel ward h. lamon 1872 portions reprinted in chapter viii abraham lincoln deist and admirer of thomas paine from the book religious beliefs of our presidents by franklin steiner 1936. lincoln was just seven years old when in 1816 the family was forced to make a new start in perry county now in spencer county indiana. he later noted that this move was partly on account of slavery and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in kentucky unlike land in the northwest territory kentucky never had a proper u.s. survey and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property. lincoln was only nine when his mother then thirtyfour years old died of milk sickness. soon afterwards his father remarried to sarah bush johnston. sarah lincoln raised young lincoln like one of her own children. years later she compared lincoln to her own son saying both were good boys but i must say both now being dead that abe was the best boy i ever saw or ever expect to see. lincoln was affectionate toward his stepmother whom he would call mother for the rest of his life but he was distant from his father. donald 1995 pp. 28 152.. in 1830 after more economic and landtitle difficulties in indiana the family settled on public land ref in macon county illinois. some scholars believe that it was his fathers repeated landtitle difficulties and ensuing financial hardships that led young lincoln to study law. the following winter was desolate and especially brutal and the family considered moving back to indiana. the following year when his father relocated the family to a new homestead in coles county illinois twentytwoyearold lincoln struck out on his own canoeing down the sangamon river to the village of new salem in sangamon county. later that year hired by new salem businessman denton offutt and accompanied by friends he took goods from new salem to new orleans via flatboat on the sangamon illinois and mississippi rivers. while in new orleans he may have witnessed a slave auction though as a frequent visitor to kentucky he would have had several earlier opportunities to witness similar sales. donald 1995 ch. 2.. lincolns formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling. largely selfeducated he read every book he could get his hands on once walking. just to borrow one while his favorite book was the life of george washington lincoln mastered the bible shakespeare and english and american history and developed a plain writing style that puzzled audiences more used to grandiose rhetoric. he was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an ax some rails he had allegedly split in his youth were exhibited at the 1860 republican national convention as the party celebrated the poorboymadegood theme. lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals even for food. though he was unusually tall at 4 inches and strong lincoln spent so much time reading that some neighbors suspected he must be doing it to avoid strenuous manual labor.. young abraham lincoln. lincoln began his political career in 1832 at age 23 with an unsuccessful campaign for the illinois general assembly as a member of the whig party. he ran eighth in a field of 13 candidates. the centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the sangamon river. he believed that this would attract steamboat traffic which would allow the sparsely populated poorer areas along the river to flourish.. he was elected captain of an illinois militia company drawn from new salem during the black hawk war and later wrote that he had not had any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction. thomas 1952 3234 basler 1946 p. 551 though he never saw combat lincoln did assist in burying the dead from the battle of stillmans run the day after major isaiah stillmans troops fled the field of battle. abraham lincoln online retrieved on march 11 2007. for several months lincoln ran a small store in new salem selling tea coffee sugar salt blue calico brown muslin straw hats and whiskey. beveridge 1928 11278 later he found work as village postmaster and as a surveyor.. in 1834 he won election to the state legislature and after coming across the commentaries on the laws of england began to teach himself law. admitted to the bar in 1837 he moved to springfield illinois that same year and began to practice law with john t. stuart. with a reputation as a formidable adversary during crossexaminations and in his closing arguments lincoln became one of the most respected and successful lawyers in illinois and grew steadily more prosperous.. he served four successive terms in the illinois house of representatives as a representative from sangamon county and became a leader of the illinois whig party. in 1837 he made his first protest against slavery in the illinois house stating that the institution was founded on both injustice and bad policy. protest in illinois legislature on slavery p.75 march 3 1837 it was also in this same year that lincoln met joshua fry speed who would become his most intimate friend.. lincoln wrote a series of anonymous letters published in 1842 in the sangamon journal mocking state auditor and prominent democrat james shields. shields would later become a u.s. senator but when he learned that it was lincoln who had been writing the barbs he challenged him to a duel. as shields was the challenger lincoln was granted the right to choose the weapon and specified cavalry broad swords of the largest size. much taller and with long arms this gave him an overwhelming advantage over his opponent however the duel was called off at the last minute. beveridge 1928 1349. lincoln had been practicing with the broad sword. two years later lincoln entered law practice with william herndon a fellow whig. in 1854 both men joined the fledgling republican party. following lincolns death herndon began collecting stories about lincoln and published them in herndons lincoln.. the first photograph ever taken of mary lincoln a daguerreotype by shepherd in 1846.. on november 4 1842 lincoln married mary todd daughter of a prominent slaveowning family from kentucky. the couple had four sons. robert todd lincoln was born in springfield illinois on 1 august 1843. their only child to survive into adulthood young robert attended phillips exeter academy and harvard college. robert died on july 26 1926 in manchester vermont.. the other lincoln children were born in springfield illinois and died either during childhood or their teen years. edward baker lincoln was born on march 10 1846 and died on 1 february 1850 also in springfield. william wallace lincoln was born on december 21 1850 and died on february 20 1862 in washington d.c. during pres. lincolns first term. thomas tad lincoln was born on 4 april 1853 and died on july 16 1871 in chicago.. four of his wifes brothers fought for the confederacy with one wounded and another killed in action. lieutenant david h. todd a halfbrother of mary todd lincoln served as commandant of the libby prison camp during the war.. the first photograph ever taken of abraham lincoln a daguerreotype taken by shepherd in 1846.. a whig and an admirer of party leader henry clay lincoln was elected to a term in the u.s. house of representatives in 1846. as a freshman house member he was not a particularly powerful or influential figure. he spoke out against the mexicanamerican war which he attributed to president polks desire for military glory that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood. he also challenged the presidents claims regarding the texas boundary and offered spot resolutions demanding to know on what spot on us soil that blood was first spilt. congressional globe 30th session 1848 pp.9395 in january of 1848 he was among the 82 whigs who defeated 81 democrats in a procedural vote on an amendment to send a routine resolution back to committee with instructions to add the words a war unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the president of the united states. the amendment passed but the bill never reemerged from committee and was never finally voted upon. house journal 30th session 1848 pp.183184. lincoln later damaged his political reputation with a speech in which he declared god of heaven has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men women and children and lay waste and pillage the land of the just. two weeks later president polk sent a peace treaty to congress. while no one in washington paid any attention to lincoln the democrats orchestrated angry outbursts from across his district where the war was popular and many had volunteered. in morgan county resolutions were adopted in fervent support of the war and in wrathful denunciation of the treasonable assaults of guerrillas at home party demagogues slanderers of the president defenders of the butchery at the alamo traducers of the heroism at san jacinto. abe lincoln resource page. warned by his law partner william herndon that the damage was mounting and irreparable lincoln decided not to run for reelection. in fact in 1848 he campaigned vigorously for zachary taylor the successful general whose atrocities he had denounced in january. regardless his statements were not easily forgotten and would haunt him during the civil war. these statements were also held against him when he applied for a position in the new taylor administration. instead taylors people offered lincoln various positions in the remote oregon territory primarily the governorship. acceptance of this offer would have ended his career in the rapidly growing state of illinois so lincoln declined the position. returning to springfield lincoln gave up politics for several years and turned his energies to his law practice. during this time he made many trips on horseback between various counties courthouses. beveridge 1928 1 42833 donald 1995 p. 14043.. in the 1920s historical markers were placed at the county lines along the route lincoln traveled in the eight judicial district. this example is on the border of piatt and dewitt counties. by the mid1850s lincolns caseload focused largely on the competing transportation interests of river barges and railroads. in one prominent 1851 case he represented the alton sangamon railroad in a dispute with a shareholder james a. barret. barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to the railroad on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest that the newer route proposed by alton sangamon was superior and less expensive and that accordingly the corporation had a right to sue barret for his delinquent payment. he won this case and the decision by the illinois supreme court was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the united states. donald 1995 ch. 6.. possibly the most notable criminal trial of lincolns career as a lawyer came in 1858 when he defended william duff armstrong who has been charged with murder. the case became famous for lincolns use of judicial noticea rare tactic at that timeto show that an eyewitness had lied on the stand. after the witness testified to having seen the crime by moonlight lincoln produced a farmers almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle that it could not have provided enough illumination to see anything clearly. based almost entirely on this evidence armstrong was acquitted. donald 1995 15051. lincoln was involved in more than 5100 cases in illinois alone during his 23year legal career. though many of these cases involved little more than filing a writ others were more substantial and quite involved. lincoln and his partners appeared before the illinois state supreme court more than 400 times. during one trial lincolns voir dire included a question to prospective jurors as to whether they were acquainted with counsel for the other side. when a few of them turned out to know the other lawyer the judge interrupted saying mr. lincoln you are wasting the time of the court. the fact that a prospective juror knows your opponent does not disqualify him.. no your honor i understand that lincoln answered. im afraid that some of them might not know him which would place me at a disadvantage.. lincoln returned to politics in response to the kansasnebraska act 1854 which expressly repealed the limits on slaverys extent as determined by the missouri compromise 1820. illinois democrat stephen a. douglas the most powerful man in the senate proposed popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse and incorporated it into the kansasnebraska act. douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory rather than have such a decision imposed on them by congress. donald 1995 ch. 7.. in a speech against the act on october 16 1854 delivered in peoria lincoln first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day. drawing on remnants of the old whig free soil liberty and democratic parties he was instrumental in forming the new republican party. in a stirring campaign the republicans carried illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. lincoln was the obvious choice but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an exdemocrat lyman trumbull.. in 185758 douglas broke with president buchanan leading to a fight for control of the democratic party. some eastern republicans even favored the reelection of douglas in 1858 since he had led the opposition to the lecompton constitution which would have admitted kansas as a slave state. accepting the republican nomination for senate in 1858 lincoln delivered his famous speech a house divided against itself cannot stand.mark 325 i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided. it will become all one thing or all the other. a house divided against itself cannot stand june 1858 the speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate and rallied republicans across the north.. the 1858 campaign featured the lincolndouglas debates a nationally famous contest on slavery. lincoln warned that the slave power was threatening the values of republicanism while douglas emphasized the supremacy of democracy as set forth in his freeport doctrine which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not. though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature reelected douglas to the senate. nevertheless lincolns eloquence transformed him into a national political star.. during the debates of 1858 the issue of race was often discussed. during a time period when few believed in racial egalitarianism stephen douglas informed the crowds if you desire negro citizenship if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves then support mr. lincoln and the black republican party who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro. first debate with stephen a. douglas at ottawa illinois august 21 1858 lincoln countered that he was not in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races. fourth debate with stephen a. douglas at charleston illinois september 18 1858 his opposition to slavery was opposition to the slave power though this would change during the course of the civil war. donald 1995 ch. 8.. on may 910 1860 the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur. at this convention lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.. the rail candidate lincolns 1860 candidacy is held up by slavery issue slave on left and party organization new york tribune editor horace greeley on right. photo of lincoln taken february 27 1860 in new york city by mathew brady the day of his famous cooper union speech.. entering the presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog lincoln was eventually chosen as the republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. his expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals william h. seward and salmon p. chase. his western origins also appealed to the newer states other contenders especially those with more governmental experience had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states while lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the west. most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party as the slave power tightened its grasp on the national government. yet despite his southern connections his inlaws owned slaves lincoln misunderstood the depth of the revolution underway in the south and the emergence of southern nationalism. throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession. gabor s. boritt and the war came? abraham lincoln and the question of individual responsibility why the civil war came ed by boritt 1996 pp 330.. throughout the election lincoln did not campaign or give speeches. this was handled by the state and county republican organizations who used the latest techniques to sustain party enthusiasm and thus obtain high turnout. there was little effort to convert nonrepublicans and there was virtually no campaigning in the south except for a few border cities such as st. louis missouri and wheeling virginia indeed the party did not even run a slate in most of the south. in the north there were thousands of republican speakers tons of campaign posters and leaflets and thousands of newspaper editorials. these focused first on the party platform and second on lincolns life story making the most of his boyhood poverty his pioneer background his native genius and his rise from obscurity. his nicknames honest abe and the railsplitter were exploited to the full. the goal was to emphasize the superior power of free labor whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. thomas 1952 p 216 reinhard h. luthin the first lincoln campaign 1944 nevins vol 4. on november 6 1860 lincoln was elected as the 16th president of the united states beating democrat stephen a. douglas john c. breckinridge of the southern democrats and john bell of the new constitutional union party. he was the first republican president winning entirely on the strength of his support in the north he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the south and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other southern states. lincoln gained 1865908 votes 39.9 of the total for 180 electoral votes douglas 1380202 29.5 for 12 electoral votes breckenridge 848019 18.1 for 72 electoral votes and bell 590901 12.5 for 39 electoral votes. there were fusion tickets in some states but even if his opponents had combined in every state lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election.. as lincolns election became more likely secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the union. south carolina took the lead followed by six other cottongrowing states in the deep south. the upper south delaware maryland virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri and arkansas listened to and rejected the secessionist appeal. they decided to stay in the union though they warned lincoln that they would not support an invasion through their territory. the seven confederate states seceded before lincoln took office declaring themselves to be a new nation the confederate states of america. president buchanan and presidentelect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy.. presidentelect lincoln evaded possible assassins in baltimore and on february 23 1861 arrived in disguise in washington d.c. at his inauguration on march 4 1861 the german american turners formed lincolns bodyguard and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present ready to protect the capital from confederate invasion and local insurrection.. photograph showing the march 4 1861 inauguration of abraham lincoln in front of united states capitol.. in his first inaugural address lincoln declared i hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution the union of these states is perpetual. perpetuity is implied if not expressed in the fundamental law of all national governments arguing further that the purpose of the united states constitution was to form a more perfect union than the articles of confederation which were explicitly perpetual thus the constitution too was perpetual. he asked rhetorically that even were the constitution a simple contract would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?. also in his inaugural address in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war lincoln supported the pending corwin amendment to the constitution which had already passed congress. this amendment which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it existed was designed to appeal not to the confederacy but to the critical border states. at the same time lincoln adamantly opposed the crittenden compromise which would have permitted slavery in the territories. despite support for the crittenden compromise among some prominent republicans including william seward lincoln denounced it saying that it would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people tribe and state owning a foot of land between here and tierra del fuego.. by the time lincoln took office the confederacy was an established fact and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the union on any terms. no compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. lincoln might have allowed the southern states to secede and some republicans recommended that. however conservative democratic nationalists such as jeremiah s. black joseph holt and edwin m. stanton had taken control of buchanans cabinet around january 1 1861 and refused to accept secession. lincoln and nearly every republican leader adopted this position by march 1861 the union could not be dismantled. however as a strict follower of the constitution lincoln refused to take any action against the south unless the unionists themselves were attacked first. this finally happened in april 1861.. historian allan nevins argues that lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the union hold government property and still avoid war. he temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis overestimated the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and border states and misunderstood the conditional support of unionists in the border states. allan nevins the improvised war 18611862 1959 p 29. in april 1861 after union troops at fort sumter were fired upon and forced to surrender lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75000 troops to recapture forts protect the capital and preserve the union which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. virginia which had repeatedly warned lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state responded by seceding along with north carolina tennessee and arkansas.. the slave states of missouri kentucky maryland and delaware did not secede and lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there promising not to interfere with slavery. after the fighting started he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas especially in maryland and held in military prisons without trial. over 18000 were arrested though none were executed. one clement vallandigham was exiled but all of the remainder were released usually after two or three months see ex parte merryman.. lincoln met with his cabinet for the first reading of the emancipation proclamation draft on july 22 1862. lr edwin m. stanton salmon p. chase abraham lincoln gideon welles caleb b. smith william h. seward montgomery blair and edward bates. in july 1862 congress moved to free the slaves by passing the second confiscation act. the goal was to weaken the rebellion which was led and controlled by slave owners. while it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery the thirteenth amendment did that the act showed that lincoln had the support of congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. this new law was implemented with lincolns emancipation proclamation.. lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the united states. in 1861 1862 however he made it clear that the north was fighting the war to preserve the union not to abolish slavery. freeing the slaves became in late 1862 a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. abolitionists criticized lincoln for his sluggishness over slavery per se but on august 22 1862 lincoln explained. the emancipation proclamation announced on september 22 and put into effect on january 1 1863 freed slaves in territories not under union control. as union armies advanced south more slaves were liberated until all of them in confederate hands over three million were freed. lincoln later said i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper. the proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the thirteenth amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation. lincoln addressed the issue of his consistency in an 1864 letter to albert g. hodges. letter to albert g. hodges april 4 1864. in september 1862 thirteen northern governors met in altoona pennsylvania at the loyal war governors conference to discuss the proclamation and union war effort. in the end the state executives fully supported the presidents proclamation and also suggested the removal of general george b. mcclellan as commander of the unions army of the potomac. images of america altoona by sr. anne francis pulling 2001 10.. for some time lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. he commented favorably on colonization in the emancipation proclamation but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. as frederick douglass observed lincoln was the first great man that i talked with in the united states freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself of the difference of color. life and times of frederick douglass by frederick douglass 1895. after union victories at gettysburg vicksburg and chattanooga in 1863 victory seemed at hand and lincoln promoted ulysses s. grant generalinchief march 12 1864. when the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates lincoln supported grants strategy of wearing down lees confederate army at the cost of heavy union casualties. with an election looming he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. at the convention the republican party selected andrew johnson a war democrat from the southern state of tennessee as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. they ran on the new union party ticket uniting republicans and war democrats.. lincoln in top hat with allan pinkerton and gen. john alexander mcclernand at antietam.. nevertheless republicans across the country feared that lincoln would be defeated. acknowledging this fear lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that if he should lose the election he would nonetheless defeat the confederacy by an allout military effort before turning over the white house mark grimsley and brooks d simpson eds. the collapse of the confederacy 2001 p 80. lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.. while the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war a failure their candidate general george b. mcclellan supported the war and repudiated the platform.. lincoln provided grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to support grant and win local support for the war effort. shermans capture of atlanta in september ended defeatist jitters the democratic party was deeply split with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln the union party was united and energized and lincoln was easily reelected in a landslide. he won all but two states capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.. on march 4 1865 lincoln delivered his second inaugural address his favorite of all his speeches. at this time a victory over the rebels was at hand slavery was dead and lincoln was looking to the future.. running the machine. an 1864 cartoon featuring lincoln william fessenden edwin stanton william seward and gideon welles takes a swing at the lincoln administration. the war was a source of constant frustration for the president and occupied nearly all of his time. he had a contentious relationship with general mcclellan who became generalinchief of all the union armies in the wake of the embarrassing union defeat at the first battle of bull run and after the retirement of winfield scott in late 1861. despite his inexperience in military affairs lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. his priorities were twofold to ensure that washington d.c. was well defended and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the northern public and press. mcclellan a youthful west point graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service took a more cautious approach. he took several months to plan and execute his peninsula campaign with the objective of capturing richmond by moving the army of the potomac by boat to the peninsula between the james and york rivers. mcclellans delay irritated lincoln as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend washington d.c. lincoln insisted on holding some of mcclellans troops to defend the capital a decision mcclellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the peninsula campaign.. mcclellan a lifelong democrat who was temperamentally conservative was relieved as generalinchief after releasing his harrisons landing letter where he offered unsolicited political advice to lincoln urging caution in the war effort. mcclellans letter incensed radical republicans who successfully pressured lincoln to appoint john pope a republican as head of the new army of virginia. pope complied with lincolns strategic desire to move toward richmond from the north thus protecting the capital from attack. but pope was soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of 1862 forcing the army of the potomac to defend washington for a second time. in response to his failure pope was sent to minnesota to fight the sioux.. an 1864 mathew brady photo depicts president lincoln reading a book with his youngest son tad. panicked by lees invasion of maryland lincoln restored mcclellan to command of all forces around washington in time for the battle of antietam september 1862. the ensuing union victory enabled lincoln to release his emancipation proclamation but he relieved mcclellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed republican ambrose burnside to head the army of the potomac. burnside had promised to follow through on lincolns strategic vision for a strong offensive against lee and richmond. after burnside was stunningly defeated at fredericksburg joseph hooker was given the command despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders. joseph hooker biography hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville may 1863 and relieved of command early in the subsequent gettysburg campaign replaced by george meade.. after the union victory at gettysburg meades failure to pursue lee and months of inactivity for the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln to bring in a western general ulysses s. grant. grant already had a solid string of victories in the western theater including the battles of vicksburg and chattanooga. responding to criticism of grant lincoln was quoted as saying i cannot spare this man. he fights. grant waged his bloody overland campaign in 1864 with a strategy of a war of attrition characterized by high union losses at battles such as the wilderness and cold harbor but by proportionately higher confederate losses. his invasion campaign eventually bottled lee up in the siege of petersburg so that grant could take richmond and bring the war to a close in the spring of 1865.. lincoln authorized grant to target civilians and infrastructure hoping to destroy the souths morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. this allowed generals sherman and sheridan to destroy farms and towns in the shenandoah valley georgia and south carolina. the damage caused by shermans march to the sea through georgia totaled in excess of 100 million by shermans own estimate. see hofstadter richard the united states the history of a republic prenticehall 1967 p. 446.. lincoln had a starcrossed record as a military leader possessing a keen understanding of strategic points such as the mississippi river and the fortress city of vicksburg and the importance of defeating the enemys army rather than simply capturing cities. he had however limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863 when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in ulysses s. grant. only then could he insist on using african american troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.. throughout the war lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. he spent hours at the war department telegraph office reading dispatches from his generals. he visited battle sites frequently and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. during jubal anderson earlys raid on washington d.c. in 1864 lincoln had to be told to duck to avoid being shot while observing the battle.. reconstruction began during the war as lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the southern states and what to do with confederate leaders and the freed slaves. lincoln led the moderates regarding reconstructionist policy and was usually opposed by the radical republicans under thaddeus stevens in the house and charles sumner and benjamin wade in the senate though he cooperated with these men on most other issues. determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the south lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind union lines. his amnesty proclamation of december 8 1863 offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office had not mistreated union prisoners and would sign an oath of allegiance. ref critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. of special importance were tennessee where lincoln appointed andrew johnson as governor and louisiana where lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. the radicals thought this policy too lenient and passed their own plan the wadedavis bill in 1864. when lincoln pocketvetoed the bill the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from louisiana arkansas and tennessee. donald 1995 ch. 20. on april 9 1865 lee surrendered at appomattox court house in virginia and the war was effectively over. the other rebel armies surrendered soon after and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare. lincoln went to richmond to make a public gesture of sitting at jefferson daviss own desk symbolically saying to the nation that the president of the united states held authority over the entire land. he was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirers quote i know i am free for i have seen the face of father abraham and have felt him. when a general asked lincoln how the defeated confederates should be treated lincoln replied let em up easy. donald 1995 576 580 president lincoln enters richmond 1865 eyewitness to history www.eywitnesstohistory.com 2000.. one of the last photographs of lincoln likely taken between february and april 1865. lincolns powerful rhetoric defined the issues of the war for the nation the world and posterity. his extraordinary command of the english language was evidenced in the gettysburg address a speech dedicating the cemetery at gettysburg that he delivered on november 19 1863. the speech defied lincolns own prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here. lincolns second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted. in these speeches lincoln articulated better than anyone else the rationale behind the union cause.. in recent years historians have stressed lincolns use of and redefinition of republican values. as early as the 1850s a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the constitution lincoln shifted emphasis to the declaration of independence as the foundation of american political valueswhat he called the sheet anchor of republicanism. jaffa 2000 p. 399 the declarations emphasis on freedom and equality for all rather than the constitutions tolerance of slavers shifted the debate. as diggins concludes regarding the highly influential cooper union speech lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself. john patrick diggins the lost soul of american politics virtue selfinterest and the foundations of liberalism 1986 p. 307. his position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism rather than its legalisms. foner 1970 p. 215 says lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism. see also mcpherson 1992 pp.6164. nevertheless in 1861 lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms the constitution was a contract and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state. jaffa 2000 p. 263 that duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in reconstruction.. lincolns second inauguration on march 4 1865. in the photo lincolns assassin john wilkes booth can be seen in the crowd at the top and accomplices david herold lewis powell george atzerodt john surratt and edmund spangler in the bottom crowd. in his gettysburg address lincoln redefined the american nation arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776 conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. he declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth. by emphasizing the centrality of the nation he rebuffed the claims of state sovereignty. while some critics say lincoln moved too far and too fast h.l. mencken said it is difficult to imagine anything more untrue. the union soldiers in the battle actually fought against selfdetermination it was the confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves. mencken did not mention the right of selfdetermination rights for blacks. they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked a new founding of the nation. wills 1992 p. 39.. during the civil war lincoln appropriated powers no previous president had wielded he used his war powers to proclaim a blockade suspended the writ of habeas corpus spent money without congressional authorization and imprisoned 18000 suspected confederate sympathizers without trial. nearly all of his actions although vehemently denounced by the copperheads were subsequently upheld by congress and the courts.. lincoln believed in the whig theory of the presidency which left congress to write the laws while he signed them vetoing only those bills that threatened his war powers. thus he signed the homestead act in 1862 making millions of acres of governmentheld land in the west available for purchase at very low cost. the morrill landgrant colleges act also signed in 1862 provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state. the pacific railway acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the united states first transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869. other important legislation involved economic matters including the first income tax and higher tariffs. also included was the creation of the system of national banks by the national banking acts of 1863 1864 and 1865 which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system. congress created and lincoln approved the department of agriculture in 1862 although that institution would not become a cabinetlevel department until 1889.. the legal tender act of 1862 established the united states note the first paper currency in united states history. this was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.. during the war lincolns treasury department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied souththe most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.. in

dying of his wounds soon after.. an army surgeon doctor charles leale initially assessed lincolns wound as mortal. the president was taken across the street from the theater to the petersen house where he lay in a coma for nine hours before he died. several physicians attended lincoln including u.s. army surgeon general joseph k. barnes of the army medical museum. using a probe barnes located some fragments of lincolns skull and the ball lodged 6 inches 15 cm inside his brain. lincoln never regained consciousness and was officially pronounced dead at 72210 a.m. april 15 1865 at the age of 56. there is some disagreement among historians as to stantons words after lincoln died. all agree that he began now he belongs to the... with some stating he said ages while others believe he said angels. after lincolns body was returned to the white house his body was prepared for his lying in repose in the east room. he was the first president to lie in state.. the army medical museum now named the national museum of health and medicine has retained in its collection several artifacts relating to the assassination. currently on display are the bullet that was fired from the derringer pistol the probe used by barnes pieces of lincolns skull and hair and the surgeons cuff stained with lincolns blood.. lincolns funeral train carried his remains as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son william 1654 miles 2661 km to illinois . lincolns body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to illinois. while much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the united states copperheads celebrated the death of a man they considered an unconstitutional tyrant. the lincoln tomb in oak ridge cemetery in springfield is 177 feet 54 m tall and by 1874 was surmounted with several bronze statues of lincoln. to prevent repeated attempts to steal lincolns body and hold it for ransom robert todd lincoln had lincoln exhumed and reinterred in concrete several feet thick in 1901.. with over 120 photographs taken of him lincoln was the most photographed man in the united states up to the time he was assassinated.. lincoln was known for appointing political rivals to high positions in his cabinet to keep in line all factions of his party and to let them battle each other and not combine against lincoln. historians agree that except for simon cameron it was a highly effective group.. abraham lincolns official white house portrait. lincoln appointed the following justices to the supreme court of the united states. in march 1860 in a speech in new haven connecticut lincoln said with respect to slavery whenever this question shall be settled it must be settled on some philosophical basis. no policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained. the philosophical basis for lincolns beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that lincoln be examined seriously as a man of ideas. lincoln was a strong supporter of the american whig version of liberal capitalism who more than most politicians of the time was able to express his ideas within the context of nineteenth century religious beliefs. guelzo pg. 1819. there were few people who strongly or directly influenced lincolns moral and intellectual development and perspectives. there was no teacher mentor church leader community leader or peer that lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. lacking a formal education lincolns personal philosophy was shaped by an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning. it was lincolns reading rather than his relationships that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs. guelzo pg. 20. miller pg. 5759 lincolns reading and study of the bible was an integral part of his intellectual roots.. lincoln did even as a boy largely reject organized religion but the calvinistic doctrine of necessity would remain a factor throughout his life. in 1846 lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as that the human mind is impelled to action or held in rest by some power over which the mind itself has no control. donald pg. 15. the quote came from a letter to the public in which lincoln was denying charges by a political opponent that he was a religious scoffer. in april 1864 in justifying his actions in regard to emancipation lincoln wrote i claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me. now at the end of three years struggle the nations condition is not what either party or any man devised or expected. god alone can claim it. donald pg. 514. as lincoln matured and especially during his term as president the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. on a personal level the death of his son willie in february 1862 may have caused lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace. wilson pg. 251254 after willies death in the summer or early fall of 1862 lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why from a divine standpoint the severity of the war was necessary. lincolns religious skepticism was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the lockean enlightenment and classical liberalism especially economic liberalism. guelzo pg. 20 consistent with the common practice of the whig party lincoln would often use the declaration of independence as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies. guelzo pg.194 in a february 22 1861 speech at independence hall in philadelphia lincoln said. he found in the declaration justification for whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the nativist platform of the know nothings. in claiming that all men were created free lincoln and the whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement expanded education territory to grow and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population. guelzo pg.194195. it was the declaration of independence rather than the bible that lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. he saw the declaration as more than a political document. to him as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders it was foremost a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation. miller pg. 297. while lincoln is usually portrayed bearded he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11yearold grace bedell. lincolns death made the president a martyr to many. repeated polls of historians have ranked lincoln as among the greatest presidents in u.s. history often appearing in the first position. among contemporary admirers lincoln is usually seen as personifying classical values of honesty and integrity as well as respect for individual and minority rights and human freedom in general.. many american organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image with interests ranging from the gay rightssupporting log cabin republicans to the insurance corporation lincoln national corporation. the lincoln automobile is also named after him. the ballistic missile submarine abraham lincoln ssbn602 and the aircraft carrier abraham lincoln cvn72 were named in his honor. also the liberty ship ss nancy hanks was named to honor his mother. during the spanish civil war the american faction of the international brigades named themselves the abraham lincoln brigade after lincoln.. lincoln has been memorialized in many city names notably the capital of nebraska. lincoln illinois is the only city to be named for abraham lincoln before he became president. lincolns name and image appear in numerous places. these include the lincoln memorial in washington d.c. the u.s. lincoln 5 bill and the lincoln cent

opponent of the expansion of slavery in the united states in his short autobiography written for the 1860 presidential campaign lincoln would describe his protest in the illinois legislature as one that briefly defined his position on the slavery question and so far as it goes it was then the same that it is now. this was in reference to the antiexpansion sentiments he had then expressed. doris kearns goodwin team of rivals the political genius of abraham lincoln 2005 p. 91. holzer pg. 232. writing of the cooper union speech holzer notes cooper union proved a unique confluence of political culture rhetorical opportunity technological innovation and human genius and it brought abraham lincoln to the center stage of american politics at precisely the right time and place and with precisely the right message that slavery was wrong and ought to be confined to the areas where it already existed and placed on the course of ultimate extinction... . lincoln won the republican party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year. during his term he helped preserve the united states by leading the defeat of the secessionist confederate states of america in the american civil war. he introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery issuing his emancipation proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the thirteenth amendment to the constitution in 1865.. lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort especially the selection of top generals including ulysses s. grant. historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the republican party well bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. lincoln successfully defused a war scare with the united kingdom in 1861. under his leadership the union took control of the border slave states at the start of the war. additionally he managed his own reelection in the 1864 presidential election.. opponents of the war also known as copperheads criticized him for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. conversely the radical republicans an abolitionist faction of the republican party criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. even with these problems lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches his gettysburg address is but one example of this. at the close of the war lincoln held a moderate view of reconstruction seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. his assassination in 1865 was the first presidential assassination in u.s. history and made him a martyr for the ideal of national unity.. scholars now rank lincoln among the top three u.s. presidents with the majority of those surveyed placing him first. he is noted for his lasting influence on u.s. politics including a redefinition of republicanism. as diggins explains lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the

our presidents by franklin steiner 1936. lincoln was just seven years old when in 1816 the family was forced to make a new start in perry county now in spencer county indiana. he later noted that this move was partly on account of slavery and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in kentucky unlike land in the northwest territory kentucky never had a proper u.s. survey and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property. lincoln was only nine when his mother then thirtyfour years old died of milk sickness. soon afterwards his father remarried to sarah bush johnston. sarah lincoln raised young lincoln like one of her own children. years later she compared lincoln to her own son saying both were good boys but i must say both now being dead that abe was the best boy

after more economic and landtitle difficulties in indiana the family settled on public land ref in macon county illinois. some scholars believe that it was his fathers repeated landtitle difficulties and ensuing financial hardships that led young lincoln to study law. the following winter was desolate and especially brutal and the family considered moving back to indiana. the following year when his father relocated the family to a new homestead in coles county illinois twentytwoyearold lincoln struck out on his own canoeing down the sangamon river to the village of new salem in sangamon

illinois general assembly as a member of the whig party. he ran eighth in a field of 13 candidates. the centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the sangamon river. he believed that this would attract steamboat traffic which would allow the sparsely populated poorer areas along the river to flourish.. he was elected captain of an illinois militia company

has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men women and children and lay waste and pillage the land of the just. two weeks later president polk sent a peace treaty to congress. while no one in washington paid any attention to lincoln the democrats orchestrated angry outbursts from across his district where the war was popular and many had volunteered. in morgan county resolutions were adopted in fervent support of the war and in wrathful denunciation of the treasonable assaults of guerrillas at home party demagogues slanderers of the president defenders of the butchery at the alamo traducers of the heroism at san jacinto. abe lincoln resource page. warned by his law partner william herndon that the damage was mounting and irreparable lincoln decided not to run for reelection. in fact in 1848 he campaigned vigorously for zachary taylor the successful general whose atrocities he had denounced in january. regardless his statements were not easily forgotten and would haunt him during the civil war. these statements were also held against him when he applied for a position in the new taylor administration. instead taylors people offered lincoln various positions in the remote oregon territory primarily the governorship. acceptance of this offer would have ended his career in the rapidly growing state of illinois so lincoln declined the position. returning to springfield lincoln gave up politics for several years and turned his energies to his law practice. during this time he made many trips on horseback between various counties courthouses. beveridge 1928 1 42833 donald 1995 p. 14043.. in the 1920s historical markers were placed at the county lines along the route lincoln traveled in the eight judicial district. this example is on the border of piatt and dewitt counties. by the mid1850s lincolns caseload focused largely on the competing transportation interests of river barges and railroads. in one prominent 1851 case he represented the alton sangamon railroad in a dispute with a shareholder james a. barret. barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to the railroad on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest that the newer route proposed by alton sangamon was superior and less expensive and that accordingly the corporation had a right to sue barret for his delinquent payment. he won this case and the decision by the illinois supreme court was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the united states. donald 1995 ch. 6.. possibly the most notable criminal trial of lincolns career as a lawyer came in 1858 when he defended william duff armstrong who has been charged with murder. the case became famous for lincolns use of judicial noticea rare tactic at that timeto show that an eyewitness had lied on the stand. after the witness testified to having seen the crime by moonlight lincoln produced a farmers almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle that it could not have provided enough illumination to see anything clearly. based almost entirely on this evidence armstrong was acquitted. donald 1995 15051. lincoln was involved in more than 5100 cases in illinois alone during his 23year legal career. though many of these cases involved little more than filing a writ others were more substantial and quite involved. lincoln and his partners appeared before the illinois state supreme court more than 400 times. during one trial lincolns voir dire included a question to prospective jurors as to whether they were acquainted with counsel for the other side. when a few of them turned out to know the other lawyer the judge interrupted saying mr. lincoln you are wasting the time of the court. the fact that a prospective juror knows your opponent does not disqualify him.. no your honor i understand that lincoln answered. im afraid that some of them might not know him which would place me at a disadvantage.. lincoln returned to politics in response to the kansasnebraska act 1854 which expressly repealed the limits on slaverys extent as determined by the missouri compromise 1820. illinois democrat stephen a. douglas the most powerful man in the senate proposed popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse and incorporated it into the kansasnebraska act. douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory rather than have such a decision imposed on them by congress. donald 1995 ch. 7.. in a speech against the act on october 16 1854 delivered in peoria lincoln first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day. drawing on remnants of the old whig free soil liberty and democratic parties he was instrumental in forming the new republican party. in a stirring campaign the republicans carried illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. lincoln was the obvious choice but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an exdemocrat lyman trumbull.. in 185758 douglas broke with president buchanan leading to a fight for control of the democratic party. some eastern republicans even favored the reelection of douglas in 1858 since he had led the opposition to the lecompton constitution which would have admitted kansas as a slave state. accepting the republican nomination for senate in 1858 lincoln delivered his famous speech a house divided against itself cannot stand.mark 325 i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided. it will become all one thing or all the other. a house divided against itself cannot stand june 1858 the speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate and rallied republicans across the north.. the 1858 campaign featured the lincolndouglas debates a nationally famous contest on slavery. lincoln warned that the slave power was threatening the values of republicanism while douglas emphasized the supremacy of democracy as set forth in his freeport doctrine which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not. though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature reelected douglas to the senate. nevertheless lincolns eloquence transformed him into a national political star.. during the debates of 1858 the issue of race was often discussed. during a time period when few believed in racial egalitarianism stephen douglas informed the crowds if you desire negro citizenship if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves then support mr. lincoln and the black republican party who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro. first debate with stephen a. douglas at ottawa illinois august 21 1858 lincoln countered that he was not in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races. fourth debate with stephen a. douglas at charleston illinois september 18 1858 his opposition to slavery was opposition to the slave power though this would change during the course of the civil war. donald 1995 ch. 8.. on may 910 1860 the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur. at this convention lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.. the rail candidate lincolns 1860 candidacy is held up by slavery issue slave on left and party organization new york tribune editor horace greeley on right. photo of lincoln taken february 27 1860 in new york city by mathew brady the day of his famous cooper union speech.. entering the presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog lincoln was eventually chosen as the republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. his expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals william h. seward and salmon p. chase. his western origins also appealed to the newer states other contenders especially those with more governmental experience had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states while lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the west. most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party as the slave power tightened its grasp on the national government. yet despite his southern connections his inlaws owned slaves lincoln misunderstood the depth of the revolution underway in the south and the emergence of southern nationalism. throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession. gabor s. boritt and the war came? abraham lincoln and the question of individual responsibility why the civil war came ed by boritt 1996 pp 330.. throughout the election lincoln did not campaign or give speeches. this was handled by the state and county republican organizations who used the latest techniques to sustain party enthusiasm and thus obtain high turnout. there was little effort to convert nonrepublicans and there was virtually no campaigning in the south except for a few border cities such as st. louis missouri and wheeling virginia indeed the party did not even run a slate in most of the south. in the north there were thousands of republican speakers tons of campaign posters and leaflets and thousands of newspaper editorials. these focused first on the party platform and second on lincolns life story making the most of his boyhood poverty his pioneer background his native genius and his rise from obscurity. his nicknames honest abe and the railsplitter were exploited to the full. the goal was to emphasize the superior power of free labor whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. thomas 1952 p 216 reinhard h. luthin the first lincoln campaign 1944 nevins vol 4. on november 6 1860 lincoln was elected as the 16th president of the united states beating democrat stephen a. douglas john c. breckinridge of the southern democrats and john bell of the new constitutional union party. he was the first republican president winning entirely on the strength of his support in the north he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the south and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other southern states. lincoln gained 1865908 votes 39.9 of the total for 180 electoral votes douglas 1380202 29.5 for 12 electoral votes breckenridge 848019 18.1 for 72 electoral votes and bell 590901 12.5 for 39 electoral votes. there were fusion tickets in some states but even if his opponents had combined in every state lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election.. as lincolns election became more likely secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the union. south carolina took the lead followed by six other cottongrowing states in the deep south. the upper south delaware maryland virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri and arkansas listened to and rejected the secessionist appeal. they decided to stay in the union though they warned lincoln that they would not support an invasion through their territory. the seven confederate states seceded before lincoln took office declaring themselves to be a new nation the confederate states of america. president buchanan and presidentelect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy.. presidentelect lincoln evaded possible assassins in baltimore and on february 23 1861 arrived in disguise in washington d.c. at his inauguration on march 4 1861 the german american turners formed lincolns bodyguard and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present ready to protect the capital from confederate invasion and local insurrection.. photograph showing the march 4 1861 inauguration of abraham lincoln in front of united states capitol.. in his first inaugural address lincoln declared i hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution the union of these states is perpetual. perpetuity is implied if not expressed in the fundamental law of all national governments arguing further that the purpose of the united states constitution was to form a more perfect union than the articles of confederation which were explicitly perpetual thus the constitution too was perpetual. he asked rhetorically that even were the constitution a simple contract would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?. also in his inaugural address in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war lincoln supported the pending corwin amendment to the constitution which had already passed congress. this amendment which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it existed was designed to appeal not to the confederacy but to the critical border states. at the same time lincoln adamantly opposed the crittenden compromise which would have permitted slavery in the territories. despite support for the crittenden compromise among some prominent republicans including william seward lincoln denounced it saying that it would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people tribe and state owning a foot of land between here and tierra del fuego.. by the time lincoln took office the confederacy was an established fact and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the union on any terms. no compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. lincoln might have allowed the southern states to secede and some republicans recommended that. however conservative democratic nationalists such as jeremiah s. black joseph holt and edwin m. stanton had taken control of buchanans cabinet around january 1 1861 and refused to accept secession. lincoln and nearly every republican leader adopted this position by march 1861 the union could not be dismantled. however as a strict follower of the constitution lincoln refused to take any action against the south unless the unionists themselves were attacked first. this finally happened in april 1861.. historian allan nevins argues that lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the union hold government property and still avoid war. he temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis overestimated the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and border states and misunderstood the conditional support of unionists in the border states. allan nevins the improvised war 18611862 1959 p 29. in april 1861 after union troops at fort sumter were fired upon and forced to surrender lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75000 troops to recapture forts protect the capital and preserve the union which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. virginia which had repeatedly warned lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state responded by seceding along with north carolina tennessee and arkansas.. the slave states of missouri kentucky maryland and delaware did not secede and lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there promising not to interfere with slavery. after the fighting started he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas especially in maryland and held in military prisons without trial. over 18000 were arrested though none were executed. one clement vallandigham was exiled but all of the remainder were released usually after two or three months see ex parte merryman.. lincoln met with his cabinet for the first reading of the emancipation proclamation draft on july 22 1862. lr edwin m. stanton salmon p. chase abraham lincoln gideon welles caleb b. smith william h. seward montgomery blair and edward bates. in july 1862 congress moved to free the slaves by passing the second confiscation act. the goal was to weaken the rebellion which was led and controlled by slave owners. while it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery the thirteenth amendment did that the act showed that lincoln had the support of congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. this new law was implemented with lincolns emancipation proclamation.. lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the united states. in 1861 1862 however he made it clear that the north was fighting the war to preserve the union not to abolish slavery. freeing the slaves became in late 1862 a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. abolitionists criticized lincoln for his sluggishness over slavery per se but on august 22 1862 lincoln explained. the emancipation proclamation announced on september 22 and put into effect on january 1 1863 freed slaves in territories not under union control. as union armies advanced south more slaves were liberated until all of them in confederate hands over three million were freed. lincoln later said i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper. the proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the thirteenth amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation. lincoln addressed the issue of his consistency in an 1864 letter to albert g. hodges. letter to albert g. hodges april 4 1864. in september 1862 thirteen northern governors met in altoona pennsylvania at the loyal war governors conference to discuss the proclamation and union war effort. in the end the state executives fully supported the presidents proclamation and also suggested the removal of general george b. mcclellan as commander of the unions army of the potomac. images of america altoona by sr. anne francis pulling 2001 10.. for some time lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. he commented favorably on colonization in the emancipation proclamation but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. as frederick douglass observed lincoln was the first great man that i talked with in the united states freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself of the difference of color. life and times of frederick douglass by frederick douglass 1895. after union victories at gettysburg vicksburg and chattanooga in 1863 victory seemed at hand and lincoln promoted ulysses s. grant generalinchief march 12 1864. when the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates lincoln supported grants strategy of wearing down lees confederate army at the cost of heavy union casualties. with an election looming he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. at the convention the republican party selected andrew johnson a war democrat from the southern state of tennessee as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. they ran on the new union party ticket uniting republicans and war democrats.. lincoln in top hat with allan pinkerton and gen. john alexander mcclernand at antietam.. nevertheless republicans across the country feared that lincoln would be defeated. acknowledging this fear lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that if he should lose the election he would nonetheless defeat the confederacy by an allout military effort before turning over the white house mark grimsley and brooks d simpson eds. the collapse of the confederacy 2001 p 80. lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.. while the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war a failure their candidate general george b. mcclellan supported the war and repudiated the platform.. lincoln provided grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to support grant and win local support for the war effort. shermans capture of atlanta in september ended defeatist jitters the democratic party was deeply split with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln the union party was united and energized and lincoln was easily reelected in a landslide. he won all but two states capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.. on march 4 1865 lincoln delivered his second inaugural address his favorite of all his speeches. at this time a victory over the rebels was at hand slavery was dead and lincoln was looking to the future.. running the machine. an 1864 cartoon featuring lincoln william fessenden edwin stanton william seward and gideon welles takes a swing at the lincoln administration. the war was a source of constant frustration for the president and occupied nearly all of his time. he had a contentious relationship with general mcclellan who became generalinchief of all the union armies in the wake of the embarrassing union defeat at the first battle of bull run and after the retirement of winfield scott in late 1861. despite his inexperience in military affairs lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. his priorities were twofold to ensure that washington d.c. was well defended and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the northern public and press. mcclellan a youthful west point graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service took a more cautious approach. he took several months to plan and execute his peninsula campaign with the objective of capturing richmond by moving the army of the potomac by boat to the peninsula between the james and york rivers. mcclellans delay irritated lincoln as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend washington d.c. lincoln insisted on holding some of mcclellans troops to defend the capital a decision mcclellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the peninsula campaign.. mcclellan a lifelong democrat who was temperamentally conservative was relieved as generalinchief after releasing his harrisons landing letter where he offered unsolicited political advice to lincoln urging caution in the war effort. mcclellans letter incensed radical republicans who successfully pressured lincoln to appoint john pope a republican as head of the new army of virginia. pope complied with lincolns strategic desire to move toward richmond from the north thus protecting the capital from attack. but pope was soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of 1862 forcing the army of the potomac to defend washington for a second time. in response to his failure pope was sent to minnesota to fight the sioux.. an 1864 mathew brady photo depicts president lincoln reading a book with his youngest son tad. panicked by lees invasion of maryland lincoln restored mcclellan to command of all forces around washington in time for the battle of antietam september 1862. the ensuing union victory enabled lincoln to release his emancipation proclamation but he relieved mcclellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed republican ambrose burnside to head the army of the potomac. burnside had promised to follow through on lincolns strategic vision for a strong offensive against lee and richmond. after burnside was stunningly defeated at fredericksburg joseph hooker was given the command despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders. joseph hooker biography hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville may 1863 and relieved of command early in the subsequent gettysburg campaign replaced by george meade.. after the union victory at gettysburg meades failure to pursue lee and months of inactivity for the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln to bring in a western general ulysses s. grant. grant already had a solid string of victories in the western theater including the battles of vicksburg and chattanooga. responding to criticism of grant lincoln was quoted as saying i cannot spare this man. he fights. grant waged his bloody overland campaign in 1864 with a strategy of a war of attrition characterized by high union losses at battles such as the wilderness and cold harbor but by proportionately higher confederate losses. his invasion campaign eventually bottled lee up in the siege of petersburg so that grant could take richmond and bring the war to a close in the spring of 1865.. lincoln authorized grant to target civilians and infrastructure hoping to destroy the souths morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. this allowed generals sherman and sheridan to destroy farms and towns in the shenandoah valley georgia and south carolina. the damage caused by shermans march to the sea through georgia totaled in excess of 100 million by shermans own estimate. see hofstadter richard the united states the history of a republic prenticehall 1967 p. 446.. lincoln had a starcrossed record as a military leader possessing a keen understanding of strategic points such as the mississippi river and the fortress city of vicksburg and the importance of defeating the enemys army rather than simply capturing cities. he had however limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863 when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in ulysses s. grant. only then could he insist on using african american troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.. throughout the war lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. he spent hours at the war department telegraph office reading dispatches from his generals. he visited battle sites frequently and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. during jubal anderson earlys raid on washington d.c. in 1864 lincoln had to be told to duck to avoid being shot while observing the battle.. reconstruction began during the war as lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the southern states and what to do with confederate leaders and the freed slaves. lincoln led the moderates regarding reconstructionist policy and was usually opposed by the radical republicans under thaddeus stevens in the house and charles sumner and benjamin wade in the senate though he cooperated with these men on most other issues. determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the south lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind union lines. his amnesty proclamation of december 8 1863 offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office had not mistreated union prisoners and would sign an oath of allegiance. ref critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. of special importance were tennessee where lincoln appointed andrew johnson as governor and louisiana where lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. the radicals thought this policy too lenient and passed their own plan the wadedavis bill in 1864. when lincoln pocketvetoed the bill the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from louisiana arkansas and tennessee. donald 1995 ch. 20. on april 9 1865 lee surrendered at appomattox court house in virginia and the war was effectively over. the other rebel armies surrendered soon after and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare. lincoln went to richmond to make a public gesture of sitting at jefferson daviss own desk symbolically saying to the nation that the president of the united states held authority over the entire land. he was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirers quote i know i am free for i have seen the face of father abraham and have felt him. when a general asked lincoln how the defeated confederates should be treated lincoln replied let em up easy. donald 1995 576 580 president lincoln enters richmond 1865 eyewitness to history www.eywitnesstohistory.com 2000.. one of the last photographs of lincoln likely taken between february and april 1865. lincolns powerful rhetoric defined the issues of the war for the nation the world and posterity. his extraordinary command of the english language was evidenced in the gettysburg address a speech dedicating the cemetery at gettysburg that he delivered on november 19 1863. the speech defied lincolns own prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here. lincolns second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted. in these speeches lincoln articulated better than anyone else the rationale behind the union cause.. in recent years historians have stressed lincolns use of and redefinition of republican values. as early as the 1850s a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the constitution lincoln shifted emphasis to the declaration of independence as the foundation of american political valueswhat he called the sheet anchor of republicanism. jaffa 2000 p. 399 the declarations emphasis on freedom and equality for all rather than the constitutions tolerance of slavers shifted the debate. as diggins concludes regarding the highly influential cooper union speech lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself. john patrick diggins the lost soul of american politics virtue selfinterest and the foundations of liberalism 1986 p. 307. his position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism rather than its legalisms. foner 1970 p. 215 says lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism. see also mcpherson 1992 pp.6164. nevertheless in 1861 lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms the constitution was a contract and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state. jaffa 2000 p. 263 that duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in reconstruction.. lincolns second inauguration on march 4 1865. in the photo lincolns assassin john wilkes booth can be seen in the crowd at the top and accomplices david herold lewis powell george atzerodt john surratt and edmund spangler in the bottom crowd. in his gettysburg address lincoln redefined the american nation arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776 conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. he declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth. by emphasizing the centrality of the nation he rebuffed the claims of state sovereignty. while some critics say lincoln moved too far and too fast h.l. mencken said it is difficult to imagine anything more untrue. the union soldiers in the battle actually fought against selfdetermination it was the confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves. mencken did not mention the right of selfdetermination rights for blacks. they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked a new founding of the nation. wills 1992 p. 39.. during the civil war lincoln appropriated powers no previous president had wielded he used his war powers to proclaim a blockade suspended the writ of habeas corpus spent money without congressional authorization and imprisoned 18000 suspected confederate sympathizers without trial. nearly all of his actions although vehemently denounced by the copperheads were subsequently upheld by congress and the courts.. lincoln believed in the whig theory of the presidency which left congress to write the laws while he signed them vetoing only those bills that threatened his war powers. thus he signed the homestead act in 1862 making millions of acres of governmentheld land in the west available for purchase at very low cost. the morrill landgrant colleges act also signed in 1862 provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state. the pacific railway acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the united states first transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869. other important legislation involved economic matters including the first income tax and higher tariffs. also included was the creation of the system of national banks by the national banking acts of 1863 1864 and 1865 which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system. congress created and lincoln approved the department of agriculture in 1862 although that institution would not become a cabinetlevel department until 1889.. the legal tender act of 1862 established the united states note the first paper currency in united states history. this was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.. during the war lincolns treasury department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied souththe most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.. in 1862 lincoln sent a senior general john pope to put down the sioux uprising in minnesota. presented with 303 death warrants for convicted santee dakota who had massacred innocent farmers lincoln

dying of his wounds soon after.. an army surgeon doctor charles leale initially assessed lincolns wound as mortal. the president was taken across the street from the theater to the petersen house where he lay in a coma for nine hours before he died. several physicians attended lincoln including u.s. army surgeon general joseph k. barnes of the army medical museum. using a probe barnes located some fragments of lincolns skull and the ball lodged 6 inches 15 cm inside his brain. lincoln never regained consciousness and was officially pronounced dead at 72210 a.m. april 15 1865 at the age of 56. there is some disagreement among historians as to stantons words after lincoln died. all agree that he began now he belongs to the... with some stating he said ages while others believe he said angels. after lincolns body was returned to the white house his body was prepared for his lying in repose in the east room. he was the first president to lie in state.. the army medical museum now

mourned him as the savior of the united states copperheads celebrated the death of a man they considered an unconstitutional tyrant. the lincoln tomb in oak ridge cemetery in springfield is 177 feet

stripes. their stripes come in different patterns unique to each individual. they are generally social animals and can be seen in small harems to large herds. in addition to their stripes zebras have erect mohawklike manes. unlike their closest relatives horses and asses zebras have never been truly domesticated.. there are three species of zebra the plains zebra grévys zebra and the mountain zebra. the plains zebra and the mountain zebra belong to the subgenus hippotigris but grevys zebra is the sole species of subgenus dolichohippus. the latter resembles an ass while the former two are more horselike. nevertheless dna and molecular data show that zebras do indeed have monophyletic origins. all three belong to the genus equus along with other living equids. in certain regions of kenya plains zebras and grevys zebras coexist.. the unique stripes and behaviors of zebras make these among the animals most familiar to people. they can be found in a variety of habitats such as grasslands savannas woodlands thorny scrublands mountains and coastal hills. however various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations in particular hunting for skins and habitat destruction. grevys zebra and the mountain zebra are endangered. while plains zebras are much more plentiful one subspecies the quagga went extinct in the late nineteenth century.. the name zebra comes from the old portuguese word zevra which means wild ass. the pronunciation is internationally or in north america.. zebras were the second lineage to diverge from the earliest protohorses after the asses around 4 million years ago. grevys zebra is believed to have been the first zebra species to emerge. the ancestors of the equus horses are believed to have been striped and zebras must have retained the stripes of their ancestors due to their advantage for social animals in tropical environments. extensive stripes would be of little use to equids that live in low densities in deserts like asses and some horses or ones that live in colder climates with shaggy coats and annual shading like some horses. fossils of an ancient equid were discovered in the hagerman fossil beds national monument in hagerman idaho. it was named the hagerman horse with a scientific name of equus simplicidens. it is believed to have been similar to the grevys zebra. the animals had stocky zebralike bodies and short narrow donkeylike skulls. grevys zebra also has a donkeylike skull. the hagerman horse is also called the american zebra or hagerman zebra.. zebras in botswana. there are

zebra actually the subspecies equus quagga burchellii chapmans zebra wahlbergs zebra selous zebra grants zebra boehms zebra and the quagga another extinct subspecies equus quagga quagga.. the mountain zebra equus zebra of southwest africa tends to have a sleek coat with a white belly and narrower stripes than the plains zebra. it has two subspecies and is classified as vulnerable.. grévys zebra equus grevyi is the largest type with a long narrow head making it appear rather mulelike. it is an inhabitant of the semiarid grasslands of ethiopia and northern kenya. grévys zebra is the rarest species of zebra around today and is classified as endangered.. although zebra species may have overlapping ranges they do not interbreed. this held true even when the quagga and burchells race of plains zebra shared the same area. in captivity plains zebras have been crossed with mountain zebras. the hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the plains zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern. attempts to breed a grévys zebra stallion to mountain zebra mares resulted in a high rate of miscarriage. in captivity crosses between zebras and other nonzebra equines have produced several distinct hybrids including the zebroid zeedonk zony and zorse.. it was previously believed that zebras were white animals with black stripes since some zebras have white underbellies. however embryological evidence shows that the animals background color is dark and the white stripes and bellies are additions.. a mother nursing her young blends into a stand of deadwood.. the stripes are typically vertical on the head neck forequarters and main body with horizontal stripes at the rear and on the legs of the animal. the zebra crossing is named after the zebras black and white stripes.. it has been suggested that the stripes serve as visual cues and identification. with each striping pattern unique to each individual zebras can recognize one another by their stripes.. others believe that the stripes act as a camouflage mechanism. this is accomplished in several ways. first the vertical striping helps the zebra hide in grass. while seeming absurd at first glance considering that grass is neither white nor black it is supposed to be effective against the zebras main predator the lion which is color blind. theoretically a zebra standing still in tall grass may not be noticed at all by a lion. additionally since zebras are herd animals the stripes may help to confuse predators a number of zebras standing or moving close together may appear as one large animal making it more difficult for the lion to pick out any single zebra to attack. a herd of zebras scattering to avoid a predator will also represent to that predator a confused mass of vertical stripes travelling in multiple directions making it difficult for the predator to track an individual visually as it separates from its herdmates although biologists have never observed lions appearing confused by zebra stripes.. a more recent theory supported by experiment posits that the disruptive colouration is also an effective means of confusing the visual system of the bloodsucking tsetse fly. waage j. k. 1981. how the zebra got its stripes biting flies as selective agents in the evolution of zebra colouration. j. entom. soc. south africa. 44 351 358. alternative theories include that the stripes coincide with fat patterning beneath the skin serving as a thermoregulatory mechanism for the zebra and that wounds sustained disrupt the striping pattern to clearly indicate

stripes. their stripes come in different patterns unique to each individual. they are generally social animals and can be seen in small harems to large herds. in addition to their stripes zebras have erect mohawklike manes. unlike their closest relatives horses and asses zebras have never been truly domesticated.. there are three species of zebra the plains zebra grévys zebra and the mountain zebra. the plains zebra and the mountain zebra belong to the subgenus hippotigris but grevys zebra is the sole species of subgenus dolichohippus. the latter resembles an ass while the former two are more horselike. nevertheless dna and molecular data show that zebras do indeed have monophyletic origins. all three belong to the genus equus along with other living equids. in certain regions of kenya plains zebras and grevys zebras coexist.. the unique stripes and behaviors of zebras make these among the animals most familiar to people. they can be found in a variety of habitats such as grasslands savannas woodlands thorny scrublands mountains and coastal hills. however various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations in particular hunting for skins and habitat destruction. grevys zebra and the mountain zebra are endangered. while plains zebras are much more plentiful one subspecies the quagga went extinct in the late nineteenth century.. the name zebra comes from the old portuguese word zevra which means wild ass. the pronunciation is internationally or in north america.. zebras were the second lineage to diverge from the earliest protohorses after the asses around 4 million years ago. grevys zebra is believed to have been the first zebra species to emerge. the ancestors of the equus horses are believed to have been striped and zebras must have retained the stripes of their ancestors due to their advantage for social animals in tropical environments. extensive stripes would be of little use to equids that live in low densities in deserts like asses and some horses or ones that live in colder climates with shaggy coats and annual shading like some horses. fossils of an ancient equid were discovered in the hagerman fossil beds national monument in hagerman idaho. it was named the hagerman horse with a scientific name of equus simplicidens. it is believed to have been similar to the grevys zebra. the animals had stocky zebralike bodies and short narrow donkeylike skulls. grevys zebra also has a donkeylike skull. the hagerman horse is also called the american zebra or hagerman zebra.. zebras in botswana. there are three extant species. collectively two of the species have 8 subspecies 7 extant. zebra populations are diverse and the relationships between and the taxonomic status of several of the subspecies are not well known.. genus equus. subgenus hippotigris. plains zebra equus quagga. quagga equus quagga quagga extinct. burchells zebra equus quagga burchellii includes damara zebra. grants zebra equus

hartmanns mountain zebra equus zebra hartmannae. subgenus dolichohippus. grévys zebra equus grevyi. an albino zebra in captivity. the plains zebra equus quagga formerly equus burchelli is the most common and has or had about twelve subspecies distributed across much of southern and eastern africa. it or particular subspecies of it have also been known as the common zebra the dauw burchells zebra actually the subspecies equus quagga burchellii chapmans zebra wahlbergs zebra selous zebra grants zebra boehms zebra and the quagga another extinct subspecies equus quagga quagga.. the mountain zebra equus zebra of southwest africa tends to have a sleek coat with a white belly and narrower stripes than the plains zebra. it has two subspecies and is classified as vulnerable.. grévys zebra equus grevyi is the largest type with a long narrow head making it appear rather mulelike. it is an inhabitant of the semiarid grasslands of ethiopia and northern kenya. grévys zebra is the rarest species of zebra around today and is classified as endangered.. although zebra species may have overlapping ranges they do not interbreed. this held true even when the quagga and burchells race of plains zebra shared the same area. in captivity plains zebras have been crossed with mountain zebras. the hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the plains zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern. attempts to breed a grévys zebra stallion to mountain zebra mares resulted in a high rate of miscarriage. in captivity crosses between zebras and other nonzebra equines have produced several distinct hybrids including the zebroid zeedonk zony and zorse.. it was previously believed that zebras were white animals with black stripes since some zebras have white underbellies. however embryological evidence shows that the animals background color is dark and the white stripes and bellies are additions.. a mother nursing her young blends into a stand of deadwood.. the stripes are typically vertical on the head neck forequarters and main body with horizontal stripes at the rear and on the legs of the animal. the zebra crossing is named after the zebras black and white stripes.. it has been suggested that the stripes serve as visual cues and identification. with each striping pattern unique to each individual zebras can recognize one another by their stripes.. others believe that the stripes act as a camouflage mechanism. this is accomplished in several ways. first the vertical striping helps the zebra hide in grass. while seeming absurd at first glance considering that grass is neither white nor black it is supposed to be effective against the zebras main predator the lion which is color blind. theoretically a zebra standing still in tall grass may not be noticed at all by a lion. additionally since zebras are herd animals the stripes may help to confuse predators a number of zebras standing or moving close together may appear as one large animal making it more difficult for the lion to pick out any single zebra to attack. a herd of zebras scattering to avoid a predator will also represent to that predator a confused mass of vertical stripes travelling in multiple directions making it difficult for the predator to track an individual visually as it separates from its herdmates although biologists have never observed lions appearing confused by zebra stripes.. a more recent theory supported by experiment posits that the disruptive colouration is also an effective means of confusing the visual system of the bloodsucking tsetse fly. waage j. k. 1981. how the zebra got its stripes biting flies as selective agents in the evolution of zebra colouration. j. entom. soc. south africa. 44 351 358. alternative theories include that the stripes coincide with fat patterning beneath the skin serving as a thermoregulatory mechanism for the zebra and that wounds sustained disrupt the striping pattern to clearly indicate the fitness of the animal to potential mates.. a zebra walking. like horses zebras walk trot canter and gallop. they are generally slower than horses but their great stamina helps them outpace predators. when chased a zebra will zigzag from side to side making it more difficult for the predator. when cornered the zebra will rear up and kick or bite its attacker.. closeup of a zebra. zebras have excellent eyesight. it is believed that they can see in color. like most ungulates the zebra has its eyes on the sides of its head giving it a wide field of view. zebras also have night vision although not as advanced as that of most of their predators but their hearing compensates.. zebras have great hearing and tend to have larger rounder ears than horses. like horses and other ungulates zebra can turn their ears in almost any direction. in addition to eyesight and hearing zebras have an acute sense of smell and taste.. zebras in tanzania. like most members of the horse family zebras are highly sociable. their social structure however depends on the species. mountain zebras and plains zebras live in groups known as harems consisting of one stallion with up to six mares and their foals. bachelor males either live alone or with groups of other bachelors until they are old enough to challenge a breeding stallion. when attacked by packs of hyenas or wild dogs a zebra group will huddle together with the foals in the middle while the stallion tries to ward them off.. unlike the other zebra species grevys zebras do not have permanent social bonds. a group of these zebras rarely stays together for more than a few months. the foals stay with their mother while the adult male lives alone. however like the other two zebra species bachelor male zebras will organize in groups.. like horses zebras sleep standing up and only sleep when neighbors are around to warn them of predators.. a zebra feeding on grass. zebras communicate with each other with high pitched barks and whinnying. grevys zebras make mulelike brays. a zebras ears signify its mood. when a zebra is in a calm tense or friendly mood its ears stand erect. when it is frightened its ears are pushed forward. when angry the ears are pulled backward. when surveying an area for predators zebras will stand in an alert posture with ears erect head held high and staring. when tense they will also snort. when a predator is spotted or sensed a zebra will bark or bray loudly.. mother and foal at the dallas zoo. zebras are very adaptable grazers. they feed mainly on grasses but will also eat shrubs herbs twigs leaves and bark. their well adapted digestive system allows them to subsist on diets of lower nutritional quality than that necessary for herbivores.. like most animal species female zebras mature earlier than the males and a mare may have her first foal by the age of three. males are not able to breed until the age of five or six. mares may give birth to one foal every twelve months. she nurses the foal for up to a year. like horses zebras are able to stand walk and suckle shortly after theyre born. a zebra foal is brown and white instead of black and white at birth.. plains and mountain zebra foals are protected by their mother as well as the head stallion and the other mares in their group. grevys zebra foals have only their mother as a regular protector since as noted above grevys zebra groups often disband after a few months.. lord rothschild with his famed zebra carriage equus burchelli which he frequently drove through london. attempts have been made to train zebras for riding since they have better resistance than horses to african diseases. however most of these attempts failed due to the zebras more unpredictable nature and tendency to panic under stress. for this reason zebramules or zebroids crosses between any species of zebra and a horse pony donkey or ass are preferred over purebred zebras.. in england the zoological collector lord rothschild frequently used zebras to draw a carriage. in 1907 rosendo ribeiro the first doctor in nairobi kenya used a riding zebra for housecalls. in the mid 1800s governor george grey imported zebras to new zealand from his previous posting in south africa and used them to pull his carriage on his privately owned kawau island.. a tamed zebra being ridden in east africa. captain horace hayes in points of the horse circa 1893 compared the usefulness of different zebra species. in 1891 hayes broke a mature intact mountain zebra stallion to ride in two days time and the animal was quiet enough for his wife to ride and be photographed upon. he found the burchells zebra easy to break in and considered it ideal for domestication as it was immune to the bite of the tsetse fly. he considered the quagga wellsuited to domestication due to being easy to train to saddle and harness. hayes capt. horace 1893 points of the horse pp. 311316 london w. thacker. modern man has had great impact on the zebra population. zebras were and still are hunted mainly for their skins. the cape mountain zebra was hunted to near extinction with less than 100 individuals by the 1930s. however the population has increased to about 700 due to conservation efforts. both mountain zebra subspecies are currently protected in national parks but are still endangered.. zebras on the botswana coat of arms. the grevys zebra is also endangered. hunting and competition from livestock have greatly decreased their population. because of the populations small size environmental hazards such as drought are capable of easily affecting the entire species. plains zebras are much more numerous and have a healthy population. nevertheless they too are threatened by hunting and habitat change from farming. one subspecies the quagga is now extinct.. zebras have been the subject of african folk tales which tell how they got their stripes. according to a bushmen folk tale of namibia the zebra was once all white but got its black stripes after a fight with a baboon over a waterhole. after kicking the baboon so hard the zebra lost his balance and tripped over a fire and the fire sticks left scorches mark all over this white coat. in the film fantasia two centaurs are depicted being half human and half zebra instead of the typical half human and half horse.. illustration of a zebra by ludolphus. zebra

stripes. their stripes come in different patterns unique to each individual. they are generally social animals and can be seen in small harems to large herds. in addition to their stripes zebras have erect mohawklike manes. unlike their closest relatives horses and asses zebras have never been truly domesticated.. there are three species of zebra the plains zebra grévys zebra and the mountain zebra. the plains zebra and the mountain zebra belong to the subgenus hippotigris but grevys zebra is the sole species of subgenus dolichohippus. the latter resembles an ass while the former two are more horselike. nevertheless dna and molecular data show that zebras do indeed have monophyletic origins. all three belong to the genus equus along with other living equids. in certain regions of kenya plains zebras and grevys zebras coexist.. the unique stripes and behaviors of zebras make these among the animals most familiar to people. they can be found in a variety of habitats such as grasslands savannas woodlands thorny scrublands mountains and coastal hills. however various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations in particular hunting for skins and habitat destruction. grevys zebra and the mountain zebra are endangered. while plains zebras are much more plentiful one subspecies the quagga went extinct in the late nineteenth century.. the name zebra comes from the old portuguese word zevra which means wild ass. the pronunciation is internationally or in north america.. zebras were the second lineage to diverge from the earliest protohorses after the asses around 4 million years ago. grevys zebra is believed to have been the first zebra species to emerge. the ancestors of the equus horses are believed to have been striped and zebras must have retained the stripes of their ancestors due to their advantage for social animals in tropical environments. extensive stripes would be of little use to equids that live in low densities in deserts like asses and some horses or ones that live in colder climates with shaggy coats and annual shading like some horses. fossils of an ancient equid were discovered in the hagerman fossil beds national monument in hagerman idaho. it was named the hagerman horse with a scientific name of equus simplicidens. it is believed to have been similar to the grevys zebra. the animals had stocky zebralike bodies and short narrow donkeylike skulls. grevys zebra also has a donkeylike skull. the hagerman horse is also called the american zebra or hagerman zebra.. zebras in botswana. there are three extant species. collectively two of the species have 8 subspecies 7 extant. zebra populations are diverse and the relationships between and the taxonomic status of several of the subspecies are not well known.. genus equus. subgenus hippotigris. plains zebra equus quagga. quagga equus quagga quagga extinct. burchells zebra equus quagga burchellii includes damara zebra. grants zebra equus

hartmanns mountain zebra equus zebra hartmannae. subgenus dolichohippus. grévys zebra equus grevyi. an albino zebra in captivity. the plains zebra equus quagga formerly equus burchelli is the most common and has or had about twelve subspecies distributed across much of southern and eastern africa. it or particular subspecies of it have also been known as the common zebra the dauw burchells zebra actually the subspecies equus quagga burchellii chapmans zebra wahlbergs zebra selous zebra grants zebra boehms zebra and the quagga another extinct subspecies equus quagga quagga.. the mountain zebra equus zebra of southwest africa tends to have a sleek coat with a white belly and narrower stripes than the plains zebra. it has two subspecies and is classified as vulnerable.. grévys zebra equus grevyi is the largest type with a long narrow head making it appear rather mulelike. it is an inhabitant of the semiarid grasslands of ethiopia and northern kenya. grévys zebra is the rarest species of zebra around today and is classified as endangered.. although zebra species may have overlapping ranges they do not interbreed. this held true even when the quagga and burchells race of plains zebra shared the same area. in captivity plains zebras have been crossed with mountain zebras. the hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the plains zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern. attempts to breed a grévys zebra stallion to mountain zebra mares resulted in a high rate of miscarriage. in captivity crosses between zebras and other nonzebra equines have produced several distinct hybrids including the zebroid zeedonk zony and zorse.. it was previously believed that zebras were white animals with black stripes since some zebras have white underbellies. however embryological evidence shows that the animals background color is dark and the white stripes and bellies are additions.. a mother nursing her young blends into a stand of deadwood.. the stripes are typically vertical on the head neck forequarters and main body with horizontal stripes at the rear and on the legs of the animal. the zebra crossing is named after the zebras black and white stripes.. it has been suggested that the stripes serve as visual cues and identification. with each striping pattern unique to each individual zebras can recognize one another by their stripes.. others believe that the stripes act as a camouflage mechanism. this is accomplished in several ways. first the vertical striping helps the zebra hide in grass. while seeming absurd at first glance considering that grass is neither white nor black it is supposed to be effective against the zebras main predator the lion which is color blind. theoretically a zebra standing still in tall grass may not be noticed at all by a lion. additionally since zebras are herd animals the stripes may help to confuse predators a number of zebras standing or moving close together may appear as one large animal making it more difficult for the lion to pick out any single zebra to attack. a herd of zebras scattering to avoid a predator will also represent to that predator a confused mass of vertical stripes travelling in multiple directions making it difficult for the predator to track an individual visually as it separates from its herdmates although biologists have never observed lions appearing confused by zebra stripes.. a more recent theory supported by experiment posits that the disruptive colouration is also an effective means of confusing the visual system of the bloodsucking tsetse fly. waage j. k. 1981. how the zebra got its stripes biting flies as selective agents in the evolution of zebra colouration. j. entom. soc. south africa. 44 351 358. alternative theories include that the stripes coincide with fat patterning beneath the skin serving as a thermoregulatory mechanism for the zebra and that wounds sustained disrupt the striping pattern to clearly indicate the fitness of the animal to potential mates.. a zebra walking. like horses zebras walk trot canter and gallop. they are generally slower than horses but their great stamina helps them outpace predators. when chased a zebra will zigzag from side to side making it more difficult for the predator. when cornered the zebra will rear up and kick or bite its attacker.. closeup of a zebra. zebras have excellent eyesight. it is believed that they can see in color. like most ungulates the zebra has its eyes on the sides of its head giving it a wide field of view. zebras also have night vision although not as advanced as that of most of their predators but their hearing compensates.. zebras have great hearing and tend to have larger rounder ears than horses. like horses and other ungulates zebra can turn their ears in almost any direction. in addition to eyesight and hearing zebras have an acute sense of smell and taste.. zebras in tanzania. like most members of the horse family zebras are highly sociable. their social structure however depends on the species. mountain zebras and plains zebras live in groups known as harems consisting of one stallion with up to six mares and their foals. bachelor males either live alone or with groups of other bachelors until they are old enough to challenge a breeding stallion. when attacked by packs of hyenas or wild dogs a zebra group will huddle together with the foals in the middle while the stallion tries to ward them off.. unlike the other zebra species grevys zebras do not have permanent social bonds. a group of these zebras rarely stays together for more than a few months. the foals stay with their mother while the adult male lives alone. however like the other two zebra species bachelor male zebras will organize in groups.. like horses zebras sleep standing up and only sleep when neighbors are around to warn them of predators.. a zebra feeding on grass. zebras communicate with each other with high pitched barks and whinnying. grevys zebras make mulelike brays. a zebras ears signify its mood. when a zebra is in a calm tense or friendly mood its ears stand erect. when it is frightened its ears are pushed forward. when angry the ears are pulled backward. when surveying an area for predators zebras will stand in an alert posture with ears erect head held high and staring. when tense they will also snort. when a predator is spotted or sensed a zebra will bark or bray loudly.. mother and foal at the dallas zoo. zebras are very adaptable grazers. they feed mainly on grasses but will also eat shrubs herbs twigs leaves and bark. their well adapted digestive system allows them to subsist on diets of lower nutritional quality than that necessary for herbivores.. like most animal species female zebras mature earlier than the males and a mare may have her first foal by the age of three. males are not able to breed until the age of five or six. mares may give birth to one foal every twelve months. she nurses the foal for up to a year. like horses zebras are able to stand walk and suckle shortly after theyre born. a zebra foal is brown and white instead of black and white at birth.. plains and mountain zebra foals are protected by their mother as well as the head stallion and the other mares in their group. grevys zebra foals have only their mother as a regular protector since as noted above grevys zebra groups often disband after a few months.. lord rothschild with his famed zebra carriage equus burchelli which he frequently drove through london. attempts have been made to train zebras for riding since they have better resistance than horses to african diseases. however most of these attempts failed due to the zebras more unpredictable nature and tendency to panic under stress. for this reason zebramules or zebroids crosses between any species of zebra and a horse pony donkey or ass are preferred over purebred zebras.. in england the zoological collector lord rothschild frequently used zebras to draw a carriage. in 1907 rosendo ribeiro the first doctor in nairobi kenya used a riding zebra for housecalls. in the mid 1800s governor george grey imported zebras to new zealand from his previous posting in south africa and used them to pull his carriage on his privately owned kawau island.. a tamed zebra being ridden in east africa. captain horace hayes in points of the horse circa 1893 compared the usefulness of different zebra species. in 1891 hayes broke a mature intact mountain zebra stallion to ride in two days time and the animal was quiet enough for his wife to ride and be photographed upon. he found the burchells zebra easy to break in and considered it ideal for domestication as it was immune to the bite of the tsetse fly. he considered the quagga wellsuited to domestication due to being easy to train to saddle and harness. hayes capt. horace 1893 points of the horse pp. 311316 london w. thacker. modern man has had great impact on the zebra population. zebras were and still are hunted mainly for their skins. the cape mountain zebra was hunted to near extinction with less than 100 individuals by the 1930s. however the population has increased to about 700 due to conservation efforts. both mountain zebra subspecies are currently protected in national parks but are still endangered.. zebras on the botswana coat of arms. the grevys zebra is also endangered. hunting and competition from livestock have greatly decreased their population. because of the populations small size environmental hazards such as drought are capable of easily affecting the entire species. plains zebras are much more numerous and have a healthy population. nevertheless they too are threatened by hunting and habitat change from farming. one subspecies the quagga is now extinct.. zebras have been the subject of african folk tales which tell how they got their stripes. according to a bushmen folk tale of namibia the zebra was once all white but got its black stripes after a fight with a baboon over a waterhole. after kicking the baboon so hard the zebra lost his balance and tripped over a fire and the fire sticks left scorches mark all over this white coat. in the film fantasia two centaurs are depicted being half human and half zebra instead of the typical half human and half horse.. illustration of a zebra by ludolphus. zebra

stripes. their stripes come in different patterns unique to each individual. they are generally social animals and can be seen in small harems to large herds. in addition to their stripes zebras have erect mohawklike manes. unlike their closest relatives horses and asses zebras have never been truly domesticated.. there are three species of zebra the plains zebra grévys zebra and the mountain zebra. the plains zebra and the mountain zebra belong to the subgenus hippotigris but grevys zebra is the sole species of subgenus dolichohippus. the latter resembles an ass while the former two are more horselike. nevertheless dna and molecular data show that zebras do indeed have monophyletic origins. all three belong to the genus equus along with other living equids. in certain regions of kenya plains zebras and grevys zebras coexist.. the unique stripes and behaviors of zebras make these among the animals most familiar to people. they can be found in a variety of habitats such as grasslands savannas woodlands thorny scrublands mountains and coastal hills. however various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations in particular hunting for skins and habitat destruction. grevys zebra and the mountain zebra are endangered. while plains zebras are much more plentiful one subspecies the quagga went extinct in the late nineteenth century.. the name zebra comes from the old portuguese word zevra which means wild ass. the pronunciation is internationally or in north america.. zebras were the second lineage to diverge from the earliest protohorses after the asses around 4 million years ago. grevys zebra is believed to have been the first zebra species to emerge. the ancestors of the equus horses are believed to have been striped and zebras must have retained the stripes of their ancestors due to their advantage for social animals in tropical environments. extensive stripes would be of little use to equids that live in low densities in deserts like asses and some horses or ones that live in colder climates with shaggy coats and annual shading like some horses. fossils of an ancient equid were discovered in the hagerman fossil beds national monument in hagerman idaho. it was named the hagerman horse with a scientific name of equus simplicidens. it is believed to have been similar to the grevys zebra. the animals had stocky zebralike bodies and short narrow donkeylike skulls. grevys zebra also has a donkeylike skull. the hagerman horse is also called the american zebra or hagerman zebra.. zebras in botswana. there are three extant species. collectively two of the species have 8 subspecies 7 extant. zebra populations are diverse and the relationships between and the taxonomic status of several of the subspecies are not well known.. genus equus. subgenus hippotigris. plains zebra equus quagga. quagga equus quagga quagga extinct. burchells zebra equus quagga burchellii includes damara zebra. grants zebra equus

hartmanns mountain zebra equus zebra hartmannae. subgenus dolichohippus. grévys zebra equus grevyi. an albino zebra in captivity. the plains zebra equus quagga formerly equus burchelli is the most common and has or had about twelve subspecies distributed across much of southern and eastern africa. it or particular subspecies of it have also been known as the common zebra the dauw burchells zebra actually the subspecies equus quagga burchellii chapmans zebra wahlbergs zebra selous zebra grants zebra boehms zebra and the quagga another extinct subspecies equus quagga quagga.. the mountain zebra equus zebra of southwest africa tends to have a sleek coat with a white belly and narrower stripes than the plains zebra. it has two subspecies and is classified as vulnerable.. grévys zebra equus grevyi is the largest type with a long narrow head making it appear rather mulelike. it is an inhabitant of the semiarid grasslands of ethiopia and northern kenya. grévys zebra is the rarest species of zebra around today and is classified as endangered.. although zebra species may have overlapping ranges they do not interbreed. this held true even when the quagga and burchells race of plains zebra shared the same area. in captivity plains zebras have been crossed with mountain zebras. the hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the plains zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern. attempts to breed a grévys zebra stallion to mountain zebra mares resulted in a high rate of miscarriage. in captivity crosses between zebras and other nonzebra equines have produced several distinct hybrids including the zebroid zeedonk zony and zorse.. it was previously believed that zebras were white animals with black stripes since some zebras have white underbellies. however embryological evidence shows that the animals background color is dark and the white stripes and bellies are additions.. a mother nursing her young blends into a stand of deadwood.. the stripes are typically vertical on the head neck forequarters and main body with horizontal stripes at the rear and on the legs of the animal. the zebra crossing is named after the zebras black and white stripes.. it has been suggested that the stripes serve as visual cues and identification. with each striping pattern unique to each individual zebras can recognize one another by their stripes.. others believe that the stripes act as a camouflage mechanism. this is accomplished in several ways. first the vertical striping helps the zebra hide in grass. while seeming absurd at first glance considering that grass is neither white nor black it is supposed to be effective against the zebras main predator the lion which is color blind. theoretically a zebra standing still in tall grass may not be noticed at all by a lion. additionally since zebras are herd animals the stripes may help to confuse predators a number of zebras standing or moving close together may appear as one large animal making it more difficult for the lion to pick out any single zebra to attack. a herd of zebras scattering to avoid a predator will also represent to that predator a confused mass of vertical stripes travelling in multiple directions making it difficult for the predator to track an individual visually as it separates from its herdmates although biologists have never observed lions appearing confused by zebra stripes.. a more recent theory supported by experiment posits that the disruptive colouration is also an effective means of confusing the visual system of the bloodsucking tsetse fly. waage j. k. 1981. how the zebra got its stripes biting flies as selective agents in the evolution of zebra colouration. j. entom. soc. south africa. 44 351 358. alternative theories include that the stripes coincide with fat patterning beneath the skin serving as a thermoregulatory mechanism for the zebra and that wounds sustained disrupt the striping pattern to clearly indicate the fitness of the animal to potential mates.. a zebra walking. like horses zebras walk trot canter and gallop. they are generally slower than horses but their great stamina helps them outpace predators. when chased a zebra will zigzag from side to side making it more difficult for the predator. when cornered the zebra will rear up and kick or bite its attacker.. closeup of a zebra. zebras have excellent eyesight. it is believed that they can see in color. like most ungulates the zebra has its eyes on the sides of its head giving it a wide field of view. zebras also have night vision although not as advanced as that of most of their predators but their hearing compensates.. zebras have great hearing and tend to have larger rounder ears than horses. like horses and other ungulates zebra can turn their ears in almost any direction. in addition to eyesight and hearing zebras have an acute sense of smell and taste.. zebras in tanzania. like most members of the horse family zebras are highly sociable. their social structure however depends on the species. mountain zebras and plains zebras live in groups known as harems consisting of one stallion with up to six mares and their foals. bachelor males either live alone or with groups of other bachelors until they are old enough to challenge a breeding stallion. when attacked by packs of hyenas or wild dogs a zebra group will huddle together with the foals in the middle while the stallion tries to ward them off.. unlike the other zebra species grevys zebras do not have permanent social bonds. a group of these zebras rarely stays together for more than a few months. the foals stay with their mother while the adult male lives alone. however like the other two zebra species bachelor male zebras will organize in groups.. like horses zebras sleep standing up and only sleep when neighbors are around to warn them of predators.. a zebra feeding on grass. zebras communicate with each other with high pitched barks and whinnying. grevys zebras make mulelike brays. a zebras ears signify its mood. when a zebra is in a calm tense or friendly mood its ears stand erect. when it is frightened its ears are pushed forward. when angry the ears are pulled backward. when surveying an area for predators zebras will stand in an alert posture with ears erect head held high and staring. when tense they will also snort. when a predator is spotted or sensed a zebra will bark or bray loudly.. mother and foal at the dallas zoo. zebras are very adaptable grazers. they feed mainly on grasses but will also eat shrubs herbs twigs leaves and bark. their well adapted digestive system allows them to subsist on diets of lower nutritional quality than that necessary for herbivores.. like most animal species female zebras mature earlier than the males and a mare may have her first foal by the age of three. males are not able to breed until the age of five or six. mares may give birth to one foal every twelve months. she nurses the foal for up to a year. like horses zebras are able to stand walk and suckle shortly after theyre born. a zebra foal is brown and white instead of black and white at birth.. plains and mountain zebra foals are protected by their mother as well as the head stallion and the other mares in their group. grevys zebra foals have only their mother as a regular protector since as noted above grevys zebra groups often disband after a few months.. lord rothschild with his famed zebra carriage equus burchelli which he frequently drove through london. attempts have been made to train zebras for riding since they have better resistance than horses to african diseases. however most of these attempts failed due to the zebras more unpredictable nature and tendency to panic under stress. for this reason zebramules or zebroids crosses between any species of zebra and a horse pony donkey or ass are preferred over purebred zebras.. in england the zoological collector lord rothschild frequently used zebras to draw a carriage. in 1907 rosendo ribeiro the first doctor in nairobi kenya used a riding zebra for housecalls. in the mid 1800s governor george grey imported zebras to new zealand from his previous posting in south africa and used them to pull his carriage on his privately owned kawau island.. a tamed zebra being ridden in east africa. captain horace hayes in points of the horse circa 1893 compared the usefulness of different zebra species. in 1891 hayes broke a mature intact mountain zebra stallion to ride in two days time and the animal was quiet enough for his wife to ride and be photographed upon. he found the burchells zebra easy to break in and considered it ideal for domestication as it was immune to the bite of the tsetse fly. he considered the quagga wellsuited to domestication due to being easy to train to saddle and harness. hayes capt. horace 1893 points of the horse pp. 311316 london w. thacker. modern man has had great impact on the zebra population. zebras were and still are hunted mainly for their skins. the cape mountain zebra was hunted to near extinction with less than 100 individuals by the 1930s. however the population has increased to about 700 due to conservation efforts. both mountain zebra subspecies are currently protected in national parks but are still endangered.. zebras on the botswana coat of arms. the grevys zebra is also endangered. hunting and competition from livestock have greatly decreased their population. because of the populations small size environmental hazards such as drought are capable of easily affecting the entire species. plains zebras are much more numerous and have a healthy population. nevertheless they too are threatened by hunting and habitat change from farming. one subspecies the quagga is now extinct.. zebras have been the subject of african folk tales which tell how they got their stripes. according to a bushmen folk tale of namibia the zebra was once all white but got its black stripes after a fight with a baboon over a waterhole. after kicking the baboon so hard the zebra lost his balance and tripped over a fire and the fire sticks left scorches mark all over this white coat. in the film fantasia two centaurs are depicted being half human and half zebra instead of the typical half human and half horse.. illustration of a zebra by ludolphus. zebra

stripes. their stripes come in different patterns unique to each individual. they are generally social animals and can be seen in small harems to large herds. in addition to their stripes zebras have erect mohawklike manes. unlike their closest relatives horses and asses zebras have never been truly domesticated.. there are three species of zebra the plains zebra grévys zebra and the mountain zebra. the plains zebra and the mountain zebra belong to the subgenus hippotigris but grevys zebra is the sole species of subgenus dolichohippus. the latter resembles an ass while the former two are more horselike. nevertheless dna and molecular data show that zebras do indeed have monophyletic origins. all three belong to the genus equus along with other living equids. in certain regions of kenya plains zebras and grevys zebras coexist.. the unique stripes and behaviors of zebras make these among the animals most familiar to people. they can be found in a variety of habitats such as grasslands savannas woodlands thorny scrublands mountains and coastal hills. however various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations in particular hunting for skins and habitat destruction. grevys zebra and the mountain zebra are endangered. while plains zebras are much more plentiful one subspecies the quagga went extinct in the late nineteenth century.. the name zebra comes from the old portuguese word zevra which means wild ass. the pronunciation is internationally or in north america.. zebras were the second lineage to diverge from the earliest protohorses after the asses around 4 million years ago. grevys zebra is believed to have been the first zebra species to emerge. the ancestors of the equus horses are believed to have been striped and zebras must have retained the stripes of their ancestors due to their advantage for social animals in tropical environments. extensive stripes would be of little use to equids that live in low densities in deserts like asses and some horses or ones that live in colder climates with shaggy coats and annual shading like some horses. fossils of an ancient equid were discovered in the hagerman fossil beds national monument in hagerman idaho. it was named the hagerman horse with a scientific name of equus simplicidens. it is believed to have been similar to the grevys zebra. the animals had stocky zebralike bodies and short narrow donkeylike skulls. grevys zebra also has a donkeylike skull. the hagerman horse is also called the american zebra or hagerman zebra.. zebras in botswana. there are three extant species. collectively two of the species have 8 subspecies 7 extant. zebra populations are diverse and the relationships between and the taxonomic status of several of the subspecies are not well known.. genus equus. subgenus hippotigris. plains zebra equus quagga. quagga equus quagga quagga extinct. burchells zebra equus quagga burchellii includes damara zebra. grants zebra equus

zebra actually the subspecies equus quagga burchellii chapmans zebra wahlbergs zebra selous zebra grants zebra boehms zebra and the quagga another extinct subspecies equus quagga quagga.. the mountain zebra equus zebra of southwest africa tends to have a sleek coat with a white belly and narrower stripes than the plains zebra. it has two subspecies and is classified as vulnerable.. grévys zebra equus grevyi is the largest type with a long narrow head making it appear rather mulelike. it is an inhabitant of the semiarid grasslands of ethiopia and northern kenya. grévys zebra is the rarest species of zebra around today and is classified as endangered.. although zebra species may have overlapping ranges they do not interbreed. this held true even when the quagga and burchells race of plains zebra shared the same area. in captivity plains zebras have been crossed with mountain zebras. the hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the plains zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern. attempts to breed a grévys zebra stallion to mountain zebra mares resulted in a high rate of miscarriage. in captivity crosses between zebras and other nonzebra equines have produced several distinct hybrids including the zebroid zeedonk zony and zorse.. it was previously believed that zebras were white animals with black stripes since some zebras have white underbellies. however embryological evidence shows that the animals background color is dark and the white stripes and bellies are additions.. a mother nursing her young blends into a stand of deadwood.. the stripes are typically vertical on the head neck forequarters and main body with horizontal stripes at the rear and on the legs of the animal. the zebra crossing is named after the zebras black and white stripes.. it has been suggested that the stripes serve as visual cues and identification. with each striping pattern unique to each individual zebras can recognize one another by their stripes.. others believe that the stripes act as a camouflage mechanism. this is accomplished in several ways. first the vertical striping helps the zebra hide in grass. while seeming absurd at first glance considering that grass is neither white nor black it is supposed to be effective against the zebras main predator the lion which is color blind. theoretically a zebra standing still in tall grass may not be noticed at all by a lion. additionally since zebras are herd animals the stripes may help to confuse predators a number of zebras standing or moving close together may appear as one large animal making it more difficult for the lion to pick out any single zebra to attack. a herd of zebras scattering to avoid a predator will also represent to that predator a confused mass of vertical stripes travelling in multiple directions making it difficult for the predator to track an individual visually as it separates from its herdmates although biologists have never observed lions appearing confused by zebra stripes.. a more recent theory supported by experiment posits that the disruptive colouration is also an effective means of confusing the visual system of the bloodsucking tsetse fly. waage j. k. 1981. how the zebra got its stripes biting flies as selective agents in the evolution of zebra colouration. j. entom. soc. south africa. 44 351 358. alternative theories include that the stripes coincide with fat patterning beneath the skin serving as a thermoregulatory mechanism for the zebra and that wounds sustained disrupt the striping pattern to clearly indicate the fitness of the animal to potential mates.. a zebra walking. like horses zebras walk trot canter and gallop. they are generally slower than horses but their great stamina helps them outpace predators. when chased a zebra will zigzag from side to side making it more difficult for the predator. when cornered the zebra will rear up and kick or bite its attacker.. closeup of a zebra. zebras have excellent eyesight. it is believed that they can see in color. like most ungulates the zebra has its eyes on the sides of its head giving it a wide field of view. zebras also have night vision although not as advanced as that of most of their predators but their hearing compensates.. zebras have great hearing and tend to have larger rounder ears than horses. like horses and other ungulates zebra can turn their ears in almost any direction. in addition to eyesight and hearing zebras have an acute sense of smell and taste.. zebras in tanzania. like most members of the horse family zebras are highly sociable. their social structure however depends on the species. mountain zebras and plains zebras live in groups known as harems consisting of one stallion with up to six mares and their foals. bachelor males either live alone or with groups of other bachelors until they are old enough to challenge a breeding stallion. when attacked by packs of hyenas or wild dogs a zebra group will huddle together with the foals in the middle while the stallion tries to ward them off.. unlike the other zebra species grevys zebras do not have permanent social bonds. a group of these zebras rarely stays together for more than a few months. the foals stay with their mother while the adult male lives alone. however like the other two zebra species bachelor male zebras will organize in groups.. like horses zebras sleep standing up and only sleep when neighbors are around to warn them of predators.. a zebra feeding on grass. zebras communicate with each other with high pitched barks and

predator is spotted or sensed a zebra will bark or bray loudly.. mother and foal at the dallas zoo. zebras are very adaptable grazers. they feed mainly on grasses but will also eat shrubs herbs twigs leaves and bark. their well adapted digestive system allows them to subsist on diets of lower nutritional quality than that necessary for herbivores.. like most animal species female zebras mature earlier than the males and a mare may have her first foal by the age of three. males are not able to breed until the age of five or six. mares may give birth to one foal every twelve months. she nurses the foal for up to a year. like horses zebras are able to stand walk and suckle shortly after theyre born. a zebra foal is brown and white instead of black and white at birth.. plains and mountain zebra foals are protected by their mother as well as the head stallion and the other mares in their group. grevys zebra foals have only their mother as a regular protector since as noted above grevys zebra groups often disband after a few months.. lord rothschild with his famed zebra carriage equus burchelli which he frequently drove through london. attempts have been made to train zebras for riding since they have better resistance than horses to african diseases. however most of these attempts failed due to the zebras more unpredictable nature and tendency to panic under stress. for this reason zebramules or zebroids crosses between any species of zebra and a horse pony donkey or ass are preferred over purebred zebras.. in england the zoological collector lord rothschild frequently used zebras to draw a carriage. in 1907 rosendo ribeiro the first doctor in nairobi kenya used a riding zebra for housecalls. in the mid 1800s governor george grey imported zebras to new zealand from his previous posting in south africa and used them to pull his carriage on his privately owned kawau island.. a tamed zebra being ridden in east africa. captain horace hayes in points of the horse circa 1893 compared the usefulness of different zebra species. in 1891 hayes broke a mature intact mountain zebra stallion to ride in two days time and the animal was quiet enough for his wife to ride and be photographed upon. he found the burchells zebra easy to break in and considered it ideal for domestication as it was immune to the bite of the tsetse fly. he considered the quagga wellsuited to domestication due to being easy to train to saddle and harness. hayes capt. horace 1893 points of the horse pp. 311316 london w. thacker. modern man has had great impact on the zebra population. zebras were and still are hunted mainly for their skins. the cape mountain zebra was hunted to near extinction with less than 100 individuals by the 1930s. however the population has increased to about 700 due to conservation efforts. both mountain zebra subspecies are currently protected in national parks but are still endangered.. zebras on the botswana coat of arms. the grevys zebra is also endangered. hunting and competition from livestock have greatly decreased their population. because of the populations small size environmental hazards such as drought are capable of easily affecting the entire species. plains zebras are much more numerous and have a healthy population. nevertheless they too are threatened by hunting and habitat change from farming. one subspecies the quagga is now extinct.. zebras have been the subject of african folk tales which tell how they got their stripes. according to a bushmen folk tale of namibia the zebra was once all white but got its black stripes after a fight with a baboon over a waterhole. after kicking the baboon so hard the zebra lost his balance and tripped over a fire and the fire sticks left scorches mark

outspoken opponent of the expansion of slavery in the united states in his short autobiography written for the 1860 presidential campaign lincoln would describe his protest in the illinois legislature as one that briefly defined his position on the slavery question and so far as it goes it was then the same that it is now. this was in reference to the antiexpansion sentiments he had then expressed. doris kearns goodwin team of rivals the political genius of abraham lincoln 2005 p. 91. holzer pg. 232. writing of the cooper union speech holzer notes cooper union proved a unique confluence of political culture rhetorical opportunity technological innovation and human genius and it brought abraham lincoln to the center stage of american politics at precisely the right time and place and with precisely the right message that slavery was wrong and ought to be confined to the areas where it already existed and placed on the course of ultimate extinction... . lincoln won the republican party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year. during his term he helped preserve the united states by leading the defeat of the secessionist confederate states of america in the american civil war. he introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery issuing his emancipation proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the thirteenth amendment to the constitution in 1865.. lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort especially the selection of top generals including ulysses s. grant. historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the republican party well bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. lincoln successfully defused a war scare with the united kingdom in 1861. under his leadership the union took control of the border slave states at the start of the war. additionally he managed his own reelection in the 1864 presidential election.. opponents of the war also known as copperheads criticized him for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. conversely the radical republicans an abolitionist faction of the republican party criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. even with these problems lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches his gettysburg address is but one example of this. at the close of the war lincoln held a moderate view of reconstruction seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. his assassination in 1865 was the first presidential assassination in u.s. history and made him a martyr for the ideal of national unity.. scholars now rank lincoln among the top three u.s. presidents with the majority of those surveyed placing him first. he is noted for his lasting influence on u.s. politics including a redefinition of republicanism. as diggins explains lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself. john patrick diggins the lost soul of american politics virtue selfinterest and the foundations of liberalism 1986 p. 307. foner 1970 p. 215 noted that lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism. jaffa 2000 p. 399 stresses lincolns emphasis on the declaration of independence as what lincoln called the sheet anchor of republicanism. see also

southeast hardin county kentucky now part of larue county. this area was at the time considered the frontier. the name abraham was chosen to commemorate his grandfather who was killed in an american indian raid in 1786. donald 1995 p 21 his elder sister sarah lincoln was born in 1807 a younger brother thomas jr died in infancy. it is sometimes debated whether lincoln had marfan syndrome an autosomal dominant disorder of the connective tissue characterized by long limbs and great physical stature. marfan syndrome introduction aug 1 2006. symbolic log cabin at abraham lincoln birthplace

cash and assumption of a debt. the farm site is now preserved as part of abraham lincoln birthplace national historic site. the family belonged to a baptist church that had seceded from a larger church over the issue of slavery. though lincoln was exposed to his parents antislavery sentiment from a very young age he never joined their church or any other church for that matter. as a youth he had little use for religion. life of abraham lincoln colonel ward h. lamon 1872 portions reprinted in chapter viii abraham lincoln deist and admirer of thomas paine from the book religious beliefs of our presidents by franklin steiner 1936. lincoln was just seven years old when in 1816 the family was forced to make a new start in perry county now in spencer county indiana. he later noted that this move was partly on account of slavery and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in kentucky unlike land in the northwest territory kentucky never had a proper u.s. survey and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property. lincoln was only nine when his mother then thirtyfour years old died of milk sickness. soon afterwards his father remarried to sarah bush johnston. sarah lincoln raised young lincoln like one of her own children. years later she compared lincoln to her own son saying both were good boys but i must say both now being dead that abe was the best boy i ever saw or ever expect to see. lincoln was affectionate toward his stepmother whom he would call mother for the rest of his life but he was distant from his father. donald 1995 pp. 28 152.. in 1830 after more economic and landtitle difficulties in indiana the family settled on public land ref in macon county illinois. some scholars believe that it was his fathers repeated landtitle difficulties and ensuing financial hardships that led young lincoln to study law. the following winter was desolate and especially brutal and the family considered moving back to indiana. the following year when his father relocated the family to a new homestead in coles county illinois twentytwoyearold lincoln struck out on his own canoeing down the sangamon river to the village of new salem in sangamon county. later that year hired by new salem businessman denton offutt and accompanied by friends he took goods from new salem to new orleans via flatboat on the sangamon illinois and mississippi rivers. while in new orleans he may have witnessed a slave auction though as a frequent visitor to kentucky he would have had several earlier opportunities to witness similar sales. donald 1995 ch. 2.. lincolns formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling. largely selfeducated he read every book he could get his hands on once walking. just to borrow one while his favorite book was the life of george washington lincoln mastered the bible shakespeare and english and american history and developed a plain writing style that puzzled audiences more used to grandiose rhetoric. he was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an ax some rails he had allegedly split in his youth were exhibited at the 1860 republican national convention as the party celebrated the poorboymadegood theme. lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals even for food. though he was unusually tall at 4 inches and strong lincoln spent so much time reading that some neighbors suspected he must be doing it to avoid strenuous manual labor.. young abraham lincoln. lincoln began his political career in 1832 at age 23 with an unsuccessful campaign for the illinois general assembly as a member of the whig party. he ran eighth in a field of 13 candidates. the centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the sangamon river. he believed that this would attract steamboat traffic which would allow the sparsely populated poorer areas along the river to flourish.. he was elected captain of an illinois militia company drawn from new salem during the black hawk war and later wrote that he had not had any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction. thomas 1952 3234 basler 1946 p. 551 though he never saw

for several months lincoln ran a small store in new salem selling tea coffee sugar salt blue calico brown muslin straw hats and whiskey. beveridge 1928 11278 later he found work as village postmaster and as a surveyor.. in 1834 he won election to the state legislature and after coming across the commentaries on the laws of england began to teach himself law. admitted to the bar in 1837 he moved to springfield illinois that same year and began to practice law with john t. stuart. with a reputation as a formidable adversary during crossexaminations and in his closing arguments lincoln became one of the most respected and successful lawyers in illinois and grew steadily more prosperous.. he served four successive terms in the illinois house of representatives as a representative from sangamon county and became a leader of the illinois whig party. in 1837 he made his first protest against slavery in the illinois house stating that the institution was founded on both injustice and bad policy. protest in illinois legislature on slavery p.75 march 3 1837 it was also in this same year that lincoln met joshua fry speed who would become his most intimate friend.. lincoln wrote a series of anonymous letters published in 1842 in the sangamon journal mocking state auditor and prominent democrat james shields. shields would later become a u.s. senator but when he learned that it was lincoln who had been writing the barbs he challenged him to a duel. as shields was the challenger lincoln was granted the right to choose the weapon and specified cavalry broad swords of the largest size. much taller and with long arms this gave him an overwhelming advantage over his opponent however the duel was called off at the last minute. beveridge 1928 1349. lincoln had been practicing with the broad sword. two years later lincoln entered law practice with william herndon a fellow whig. in 1854 both men joined the fledgling republican party. following lincolns death herndon began

in 1846. as a freshman house member he was not a particularly powerful or influential figure. he spoke out against the mexicanamerican war which he attributed to president polks desire for military glory that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood. he also challenged the presidents claims regarding the texas boundary and offered spot resolutions demanding to know on what spot on us soil that blood was first spilt. congressional globe 30th session 1848 pp.9395 in january of 1848 he was among the 82 whigs who defeated 81 democrats in a procedural vote on an amendment to send a

reemerged from committee and was never finally voted upon. house journal 30th session 1848 pp.183184. lincoln later damaged his political reputation with a speech in which he declared god of heaven has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men women and children and lay waste and pillage the land of the just. two weeks later president polk sent a peace treaty to congress. while no one in washington paid any attention to lincoln the democrats orchestrated angry outbursts from across his district where the war was popular and many had volunteered. in morgan county resolutions were adopted in fervent support of the war and in wrathful denunciation of the treasonable assaults of guerrillas at home party demagogues slanderers of the president defenders of the butchery at the alamo traducers of the heroism at san jacinto. abe lincoln resource page. warned by his law partner william herndon that the damage was mounting and irreparable lincoln decided not to run for reelection. in fact in 1848 he campaigned vigorously for zachary taylor the successful general whose atrocities he had denounced in january. regardless his statements were not easily forgotten and would haunt him during the civil war. these statements were also held against him when he applied for a position in the new taylor administration. instead taylors people offered lincoln various positions in the remote oregon territory primarily the governorship. acceptance of this offer would have ended his career in the rapidly growing state of illinois so lincoln declined the position. returning to springfield lincoln gave up politics for several years and turned his energies to his law practice. during this time he made many trips on horseback between various counties courthouses. beveridge 1928 1 42833 donald 1995 p. 14043.. in the 1920s historical markers were placed at the county lines along the route lincoln traveled in the eight judicial district. this example is on the border of piatt and dewitt counties. by the mid1850s lincolns caseload focused largely on the competing transportation interests of river barges and railroads. in one prominent 1851 case he represented the alton sangamon railroad in a dispute with a shareholder james a. barret. barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to the railroad on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest that the newer route proposed by alton sangamon was superior and less expensive and that accordingly the corporation had a right to sue barret for his delinquent payment. he won this case and the decision by the illinois supreme court was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the united states. donald 1995 ch. 6.. possibly the most notable criminal trial of lincolns career as a lawyer came in 1858 when he defended william duff armstrong who has been charged with murder. the case became famous for lincolns use of judicial noticea rare tactic at that timeto show that an eyewitness had lied on the stand. after the witness testified to having seen the crime by moonlight lincoln produced a farmers almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle that it could not have provided enough illumination to see anything clearly. based almost entirely on this evidence armstrong was acquitted. donald 1995 15051. lincoln was involved in more than 5100 cases in illinois alone during his 23year legal career. though many of these cases involved little more than filing a writ others were more substantial and quite involved. lincoln and his partners appeared before the illinois state supreme court more than 400 times. during one trial lincolns voir dire included a question to prospective jurors as to whether they were acquainted with counsel for the other side. when a few of them turned out to know the other lawyer the judge interrupted saying mr. lincoln you are wasting the time of the court. the fact that a prospective juror knows your opponent does not disqualify him.. no your honor i understand that lincoln answered. im afraid that some of them might not know him which would place me at a disadvantage.. lincoln returned to politics in response to the kansasnebraska act 1854 which expressly repealed the limits on slaverys extent as determined by the missouri compromise 1820. illinois democrat stephen a. douglas the most powerful man in the senate proposed popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse and incorporated it into the kansasnebraska act. douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory rather than have such a decision imposed on them by congress. donald 1995 ch. 7.. in a speech against the act on october 16 1854 delivered in peoria lincoln first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day. drawing on remnants of the old whig free soil liberty and democratic parties he was instrumental in forming the new republican party. in a stirring campaign the republicans carried illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. lincoln was the obvious choice but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an exdemocrat lyman trumbull.. in 185758 douglas broke with president buchanan leading to a fight for control of the democratic party. some eastern republicans even favored the reelection of douglas in 1858 since he had led the opposition to the lecompton constitution which would have admitted kansas as a slave state. accepting the republican nomination for senate in 1858 lincoln delivered his famous speech a house divided against itself cannot stand.mark 325 i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided. it will become all one thing or all the other. a house divided against itself cannot stand june 1858 the speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate and rallied republicans across the north.. the 1858 campaign featured the lincolndouglas debates a nationally famous contest on slavery. lincoln warned that the slave power was threatening the values of republicanism while douglas emphasized the supremacy of democracy as set forth in his freeport doctrine which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not. though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature reelected douglas to the senate. nevertheless lincolns eloquence transformed him into a national political star.. during the debates of 1858 the issue of race was often discussed. during a time period when few believed in racial egalitarianism stephen douglas informed the crowds if you desire negro citizenship if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves then support mr. lincoln and the black republican party who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro. first debate with stephen a. douglas at ottawa illinois august 21 1858 lincoln countered that he was not in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races. fourth debate with stephen a. douglas at charleston illinois september 18 1858 his opposition to slavery was opposition to the slave power though this would change during the course of the civil war. donald 1995 ch. 8.. on may 910 1860 the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur. at this convention lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.. the rail candidate lincolns 1860 candidacy is held up by slavery issue slave on left and party organization new york tribune editor horace greeley on right. photo of lincoln taken february 27 1860 in new york city by mathew brady the day of his famous cooper union speech.. entering the presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog lincoln was eventually chosen as the republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. his expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals william h. seward and salmon p. chase. his western origins also appealed to the newer states other contenders especially those with more governmental experience had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states while lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the west. most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party as the slave power tightened its grasp on the national government. yet despite his southern connections his inlaws owned slaves lincoln misunderstood the depth of the revolution underway in the south and the emergence of southern nationalism. throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession. gabor s. boritt and the war came? abraham lincoln and the question of individual responsibility why the civil war came ed by boritt 1996 pp 330.. throughout the election lincoln did not campaign or give speeches. this was handled by the state and county republican organizations who used the latest techniques to sustain party enthusiasm and thus obtain high turnout. there was little effort to convert nonrepublicans and there was virtually no campaigning in the south except for a few border cities such as st. louis missouri and wheeling virginia indeed the party did not even run a slate in most of the south. in the north there were thousands of republican speakers tons of campaign posters and leaflets and thousands of newspaper editorials. these focused first on the party platform and second on lincolns life story making the most of his boyhood poverty his pioneer background his native genius and his rise from obscurity. his nicknames honest abe and the railsplitter were exploited to the full. the goal was to emphasize the superior power of free labor whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. thomas 1952 p 216 reinhard h. luthin the first lincoln campaign 1944 nevins vol 4. on november 6 1860 lincoln was elected as the 16th president of the united states beating democrat stephen a. douglas john c. breckinridge of the southern democrats and john bell of the new constitutional union party. he was the first republican president winning entirely on the strength of his support in the north he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the south and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other southern states. lincoln gained 1865908 votes 39.9 of the total for 180 electoral votes douglas 1380202 29.5 for 12 electoral votes breckenridge 848019 18.1 for 72 electoral votes and bell 590901 12.5 for 39 electoral votes. there were fusion tickets in some states but even if his opponents had combined in every state lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election.. as lincolns election became more likely secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the union. south carolina took the lead followed by six other cottongrowing states in the deep south. the upper south delaware maryland virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri and arkansas listened to and rejected the secessionist appeal. they decided to stay in the union though they warned lincoln that they would not support an invasion through their territory. the seven confederate states seceded before lincoln took office declaring themselves to be a new nation the confederate states of america. president buchanan and presidentelect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy.. presidentelect lincoln evaded possible assassins in baltimore and on february 23 1861 arrived in disguise in washington d.c. at his inauguration on march 4 1861 the german american turners formed lincolns bodyguard and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present ready to protect the capital from confederate invasion and local insurrection.. photograph showing the march 4 1861 inauguration of abraham lincoln in front of united states capitol.. in his first inaugural address lincoln declared i hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution the union of these states is perpetual. perpetuity is implied if not expressed in the fundamental law of all national governments arguing further that the purpose of the united states constitution was to form a more perfect union than the articles of confederation which were explicitly perpetual thus the constitution too was perpetual. he asked rhetorically that even were the constitution a simple contract would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?. also in his inaugural address in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war lincoln supported the pending corwin amendment to the constitution which had already passed congress. this amendment which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it existed was designed to appeal not to the confederacy but to the critical border states. at the same time lincoln adamantly opposed the crittenden compromise which would have permitted slavery in the territories. despite support for the crittenden compromise among some prominent republicans including william seward lincoln denounced it saying that it would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people tribe and state owning a foot of land between here and tierra del fuego.. by the time lincoln took office the confederacy was an established fact and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the union on any terms. no compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. lincoln might have allowed the southern states to secede and some republicans recommended that. however conservative democratic nationalists such as jeremiah s. black joseph holt and edwin m. stanton had taken control of buchanans cabinet around january 1 1861 and refused to accept secession. lincoln and nearly every republican leader adopted this position by march 1861 the union could not be dismantled. however as a strict follower of the constitution lincoln refused to take any action against the south unless the unionists themselves were attacked first. this finally happened in april 1861.. historian allan nevins argues that lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the union hold government property and still avoid war. he temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis overestimated the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and border states and misunderstood the conditional support of unionists in the border states. allan nevins the improvised war 18611862 1959 p 29. in april 1861 after union troops at fort sumter were fired upon and forced to surrender lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75000 troops to recapture forts protect the capital and preserve the union which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. virginia which had repeatedly warned lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state responded by seceding along with north carolina tennessee and arkansas.. the slave states of missouri kentucky maryland and delaware did not secede and lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there promising not to interfere with slavery. after the fighting started he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas especially in maryland and held in military prisons without trial. over 18000 were arrested though none were executed. one clement vallandigham was exiled but all of the remainder were released usually after two or three months see ex parte merryman.. lincoln met with his cabinet for the first reading of the emancipation proclamation draft on july 22 1862. lr edwin m. stanton salmon p. chase abraham lincoln gideon welles caleb b. smith william h. seward montgomery blair and edward bates. in july 1862 congress moved to free the slaves by passing the second confiscation act. the goal was to weaken the rebellion which was led and controlled by slave owners. while it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery the thirteenth amendment did that the act showed that lincoln had the support of congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. this new law was implemented with lincolns emancipation proclamation.. lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the united states. in 1861 1862 however he made it clear that the north was fighting the war to preserve the union not to abolish slavery. freeing the slaves became in late 1862 a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. abolitionists criticized lincoln for his sluggishness over slavery per se but on august 22 1862 lincoln explained. the emancipation proclamation announced on september 22 and put into effect on january 1 1863 freed slaves in territories not under union control. as union armies advanced south more slaves were liberated until all of them in confederate hands over three million were freed. lincoln later said i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper. the proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the thirteenth amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation. lincoln addressed the issue of his consistency in an 1864 letter to albert g. hodges. letter to albert g. hodges april 4 1864. in september 1862 thirteen northern governors met in altoona pennsylvania at the loyal war governors conference to discuss the proclamation and union war effort. in the end the state executives fully supported the presidents proclamation and also suggested the removal of general george b. mcclellan as commander of the unions army of the potomac. images of america altoona by sr. anne francis pulling 2001 10.. for some time lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. he commented favorably on colonization in the emancipation proclamation but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. as frederick douglass observed lincoln was the first great man that i talked with in the united states freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself of the difference of color. life and times of frederick douglass by frederick douglass 1895. after union victories at gettysburg vicksburg and chattanooga in 1863 victory seemed at hand and lincoln promoted ulysses s. grant generalinchief march 12 1864. when the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates lincoln supported grants strategy of wearing down lees confederate army at the cost of heavy union casualties. with an election looming he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. at the convention the republican party selected andrew johnson a war democrat from the southern state of tennessee as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. they ran on the new union party ticket uniting republicans and war democrats.. lincoln in top hat with allan pinkerton and gen. john alexander mcclernand at antietam.. nevertheless republicans across the country feared that lincoln would be defeated. acknowledging this fear lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that if he should lose the election he would nonetheless defeat the confederacy by an allout military effort before turning over the white house mark grimsley and brooks d simpson eds. the collapse of the confederacy 2001 p 80. lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.. while the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war a failure their candidate general george b. mcclellan supported the war and repudiated the platform.. lincoln provided grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to support grant and win local support for the war effort. shermans capture of atlanta in september ended defeatist jitters the democratic party was deeply split with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln the union party was united and energized and lincoln was easily reelected in a landslide. he won all but two states capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.. on march 4 1865 lincoln delivered his second inaugural address his favorite of all his speeches. at this time a victory over the rebels was at hand slavery was dead and lincoln was looking to the future.. running the machine. an 1864 cartoon featuring lincoln william fessenden edwin stanton william seward and gideon welles takes a swing at the lincoln administration. the war was a source of constant frustration for the president and occupied nearly all of his time. he had a contentious relationship with general mcclellan who became generalinchief of all the union armies in the wake of the embarrassing union defeat at the first battle of bull run and after the retirement of winfield scott in late 1861. despite his inexperience in military affairs lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. his priorities were twofold to ensure that washington d.c. was well defended and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the northern public and press. mcclellan a youthful west point graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service took a more cautious approach. he took several months to plan and execute his peninsula campaign with the objective of capturing richmond by moving the army of the potomac by boat to the peninsula between the james and york rivers. mcclellans delay irritated lincoln as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend washington d.c. lincoln insisted on holding some of mcclellans troops to defend the capital a decision mcclellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the peninsula campaign.. mcclellan a lifelong democrat who was temperamentally conservative was relieved as generalinchief after releasing his harrisons landing letter where he offered unsolicited political advice to lincoln urging caution in the war effort. mcclellans letter incensed radical republicans who successfully pressured lincoln to appoint john pope a republican as head of the new army of virginia. pope complied with lincolns strategic desire to move toward richmond from the north thus protecting the capital from attack. but pope was soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of 1862 forcing the army of the potomac to defend washington for a second time. in response to his failure pope was sent to minnesota to fight the sioux.. an 1864 mathew brady photo depicts president lincoln reading a book with his youngest son tad. panicked by lees invasion of maryland lincoln restored mcclellan to command of all forces around washington in time for the battle of antietam september 1862. the ensuing union victory enabled lincoln to release his emancipation proclamation but he relieved mcclellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed republican ambrose burnside to head the army of the potomac. burnside had promised to follow through on lincolns strategic vision for a strong offensive against lee and richmond. after burnside was stunningly defeated at fredericksburg joseph hooker was given the command despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders. joseph hooker biography hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville may 1863 and relieved of command early in the subsequent gettysburg campaign replaced by george meade.. after the union victory at gettysburg meades failure to pursue lee and months of inactivity for the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln to bring in a western general ulysses s. grant. grant already had a solid string of victories in the western theater including the battles of vicksburg and chattanooga. responding to criticism of grant lincoln was quoted as saying i cannot spare this man. he fights. grant waged his bloody overland campaign in 1864 with a strategy of a war of attrition characterized by high union losses at battles such as the wilderness and cold harbor but by proportionately higher confederate losses. his invasion campaign eventually bottled lee up in the siege of petersburg so that grant could take richmond and bring the war to a close in the spring of 1865.. lincoln authorized grant to target civilians and infrastructure hoping to destroy the souths morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. this allowed generals sherman and sheridan to destroy farms and towns in the shenandoah valley georgia and south carolina. the damage caused by shermans march to the sea through georgia totaled in excess of 100 million by shermans own estimate. see hofstadter richard the united states the history of a republic prenticehall 1967 p. 446.. lincoln had a starcrossed record as a military leader possessing a keen understanding of strategic points such as the mississippi river and the fortress city of vicksburg and the importance of defeating the enemys army rather than simply capturing cities. he had however limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863 when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in ulysses s. grant. only then could he insist on using african american troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.. throughout the war lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. he spent hours at the war department telegraph office reading dispatches from his generals. he visited battle sites frequently and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. during jubal anderson earlys raid on washington d.c. in 1864 lincoln had to be told to duck to avoid being shot while observing the battle.. reconstruction began during the war as lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the southern states and what to do with confederate leaders and the freed slaves. lincoln led the moderates regarding reconstructionist policy and was usually opposed by the radical republicans under thaddeus stevens in the house and charles sumner and benjamin wade in the senate though he cooperated with these men on most other issues. determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the south lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind union lines. his amnesty proclamation of december 8 1863 offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office had not mistreated union prisoners and would sign an oath of allegiance. ref critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. of special importance were tennessee where lincoln appointed andrew johnson as governor and louisiana where lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. the radicals thought this policy too lenient and passed their own plan the wadedavis bill in 1864. when lincoln pocketvetoed the bill the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from louisiana arkansas and tennessee. donald 1995 ch. 20. on april 9 1865 lee surrendered at appomattox court house in virginia and the war was effectively over. the other rebel armies surrendered soon after and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare. lincoln went to richmond to make a public gesture of sitting at jefferson daviss own desk symbolically saying to the nation that the president of the united states held authority over the entire land. he was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirers quote i know i am free for i have seen the face of father abraham and have felt him. when a general asked lincoln how the defeated confederates should be treated lincoln replied let em up easy. donald 1995 576 580 president lincoln enters richmond 1865 eyewitness to history www.eywitnesstohistory.com 2000.. one of the last photographs of lincoln likely taken between february and april 1865. lincolns powerful rhetoric defined the issues of the war for the nation the world and posterity. his extraordinary command of the english language was evidenced in the gettysburg address a speech dedicating the cemetery at gettysburg that he delivered on november 19 1863. the speech defied lincolns own prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here. lincolns second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted. in these speeches lincoln articulated better than anyone else the rationale behind the union cause.. in recent years historians have stressed lincolns use of and redefinition of republican values. as early as the 1850s a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the constitution lincoln shifted emphasis to the declaration of independence as the foundation of american political valueswhat he called the sheet anchor of republicanism. jaffa 2000 p. 399 the declarations emphasis on freedom and equality for all rather than the constitutions tolerance of slavers shifted the debate. as diggins concludes regarding the highly influential cooper union speech lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself. john patrick diggins the lost soul of american politics virtue selfinterest and the foundations of liberalism 1986 p. 307. his position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism rather than its legalisms. foner 1970 p. 215 says lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism. see also mcpherson 1992 pp.6164. nevertheless in 1861 lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms the constitution was a contract and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state. jaffa 2000 p. 263 that duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in reconstruction.. lincolns second inauguration on march 4 1865. in the photo lincolns assassin john wilkes booth can be seen in the crowd at the top and accomplices david herold lewis powell george atzerodt john surratt and edmund spangler in the bottom crowd. in his gettysburg address lincoln redefined the american nation arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776 conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. he declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth. by emphasizing the centrality of the nation he rebuffed the claims of state sovereignty. while some critics say lincoln moved too far and too fast h.l. mencken said it is difficult to imagine anything more untrue. the union soldiers in the battle actually fought against selfdetermination it was the confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves. mencken did not mention the right of selfdetermination rights for blacks. they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked a new founding of the nation. wills 1992 p. 39.. during the civil war lincoln appropriated powers no previous president had wielded he used his war powers to proclaim a blockade suspended the writ of habeas corpus spent money without congressional authorization and imprisoned 18000 suspected confederate sympathizers without trial. nearly all of his actions although vehemently denounced by the copperheads were subsequently upheld by congress and the courts.. lincoln believed in the whig theory of the presidency which left congress to write the laws while he signed them vetoing only those bills that threatened his war powers. thus he signed the homestead act in 1862 making millions of acres of governmentheld land in the west available for purchase at very low cost. the morrill landgrant colleges act also signed in 1862 provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state. the pacific railway acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the united states first transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869. other important legislation involved economic matters including the first income tax and higher tariffs. also included was the creation of the system of national banks by the national banking acts of 1863 1864 and 1865 which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system. congress created and lincoln approved the department of agriculture in 1862 although that institution would not become a cabinetlevel department until 1889.. the legal tender act of 1862 established the united states note the first paper currency in united states history. this was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.. during the war lincolns treasury department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied souththe most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.. in 1862 lincoln sent a senior general john pope to put down the sioux uprising in minnesota. presented with 303 death warrants for convicted santee dakota who had massacred innocent farmers lincoln affirmed 39 of these for execution one was later reprieved.. the assassination of abraham lincoln. from left to right henry rathbone clara harris mary todd lincoln abraham lincoln and john wilkes

assassination lincoln left to attend the play our american cousin on april 14 1865. as a lone bodyguard wandered and lincoln sat in his state box box 7 in the balcony booth crept up behind the president and waited for the funniest line of the play hoping the laughter would muffle the noise of the gunshot. when the laughter began booth jumped into the box and aimed a singleshot roundslug .44

12002580. a twelveday manhunt ensued in which booth was chased by federal agents under the direction of secretary of war edwin m. stanton. he was eventually cornered in a virginia barn house and shot dying of his wounds soon after.. an army surgeon doctor charles leale initially assessed lincolns wound as mortal. the president was taken across the street from the theater to the petersen house where he lay in a coma for nine hours before he died. several physicians attended lincoln including u.s. army surgeon general joseph k. barnes of the army medical museum. using a probe barnes located some fragments of lincolns skull and the ball lodged 6 inches 15 cm inside his brain. lincoln never regained consciousness and was officially pronounced dead at 72210 a.m. april 15 1865 at the age of 56. there is some disagreement among historians as to stantons words after lincoln died. all agree that he began now he belongs to the... with some stating he said ages while others believe he said angels. after lincolns body was returned to the white house his body was prepared for his lying in repose in the east room. he was the first president to lie in state.. the army medical museum now named the national museum of health and medicine has retained in its collection several artifacts relating to the assassination. currently on display are the bullet that was fired from the derringer pistol the probe used by barnes pieces of lincolns skull and hair and the surgeons cuff stained with lincolns blood.. lincolns funeral train carried his remains as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son william 1654 miles 2661 km to illinois . lincolns body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to illinois. while much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the united states copperheads celebrated the death of a man they considered an unconstitutional tyrant. the lincoln tomb in oak ridge cemetery in springfield is 177 feet 54 m tall and by 1874 was surmounted with several bronze statues of lincoln. to prevent repeated attempts to steal lincolns body and hold it for ransom robert todd lincoln had lincoln exhumed and reinterred in concrete several feet thick in 1901.. with over 120 photographs taken of him lincoln was the most photographed man in the united states up to the time he was assassinated.. lincoln was known for appointing political rivals to high positions in his cabinet to keep in line all factions of his party and to let them battle each other and not combine against lincoln. historians agree that except for simon cameron it was a highly effective group.. abraham lincolns official white house portrait. lincoln appointed the following justices to the supreme court of the united states. in march 1860 in a speech in new haven connecticut lincoln said with respect to slavery whenever this question shall be settled it must be settled on some philosophical basis. no policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained. the philosophical basis for lincolns beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that lincoln be examined seriously as a man of ideas. lincoln was a strong supporter of the american whig version of liberal capitalism who more than most politicians of the time was able to express his ideas within the context of nineteenth century religious beliefs. guelzo pg. 1819. there were few people who strongly or directly influenced lincolns moral and intellectual development and perspectives. there was no teacher mentor church leader community leader or peer that lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. lacking a formal education lincolns personal philosophy was shaped by an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning. it was lincolns reading rather than his relationships that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs. guelzo pg. 20. miller pg. 5759 lincolns reading and study of the bible was an integral part of his intellectual roots.. lincoln did even as a boy largely reject organized religion but the calvinistic doctrine of necessity would remain a factor throughout his life. in 1846 lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as that the human mind is impelled to action or held in rest by some power over which the mind itself has no control. donald pg. 15. the quote came from a letter to the public in which lincoln was denying charges by a political opponent that he was a religious scoffer. in april 1864 in justifying his actions in regard to emancipation lincoln wrote i claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me. now at the end of three years struggle the nations condition is not what either party or any man devised or expected. god alone can claim it. donald pg. 514. as lincoln matured and especially during his term as president the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. on a personal level the death of his son willie in february 1862 may have caused lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace. wilson pg. 251254 after willies death in the summer or early fall of 1862 lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why from a divine standpoint the severity of the war was necessary. lincolns religious skepticism was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the lockean enlightenment and classical liberalism especially economic liberalism. guelzo pg. 20 consistent with the common practice of the whig party lincoln would often use the declaration of independence as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies. guelzo pg.194 in a february 22 1861 speech at independence hall in philadelphia lincoln said. he found in the declaration justification for whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the nativist platform of the know nothings. in claiming that all men were created free lincoln and the whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement expanded education territory to grow and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population. guelzo pg.194195. it was the declaration of independence rather than the bible that lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. he saw the declaration as more than a political document. to him as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders it was foremost a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation. miller pg. 297. while lincoln is usually portrayed bearded he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11yearold grace bedell. lincolns death made the president a martyr to many. repeated polls of historians have ranked lincoln as among the greatest presidents in u.s. history often appearing in the first position. among contemporary admirers lincoln is usually seen as personifying classical values of honesty and integrity as well as respect for individual and minority rights and human freedom in general.. many american organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image with interests ranging from the gay rightssupporting log cabin republicans to the insurance corporation lincoln national corporation. the lincoln automobile is also named after him. the ballistic missile submarine abraham lincoln ssbn602 and the aircraft carrier abraham lincoln cvn72 were named in his honor. also the liberty ship ss nancy hanks was named to honor his mother. during the spanish civil war the american faction of the international brigades named themselves the abraham lincoln brigade after lincoln.. lincoln has been memorialized in many city names notably the capital of nebraska. lincoln illinois is the only city to be named for abraham lincoln before he became president. lincolns name and image appear in numerous places. these include the lincoln memorial in washington d.c. the u.s. lincoln 5 bill and the lincoln cent

outspoken opponent of the expansion of slavery in the united states in his short autobiography written for the 1860 presidential campaign lincoln would describe his protest in the illinois legislature

party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year. during his term he helped preserve the united states by leading the defeat of the secessionist confederate states of america in the american civil war. he introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery issuing his emancipation proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the thirteenth amendment to the constitution in 1865.. lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort especially the selection of top generals including ulysses s. grant. historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the republican party well bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. lincoln successfully defused a war scare with the united kingdom in 1861. under his leadership the union took control of the border slave states at the start of the war. additionally he managed his own reelection in the 1864 presidential election.. opponents of the war also known as copperheads criticized him for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. conversely the radical republicans an abolitionist faction of the republican party criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. even with these problems lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches his gettysburg address is but one example of this. at the close of the war lincoln held a moderate view of reconstruction seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. his assassination in 1865 was the first presidential assassination in u.s. history and made him a martyr for the ideal of national unity.. scholars now rank lincoln among the top three u.s. presidents with the majority of those surveyed placing him first. he is noted for his lasting influence on u.s. politics including a redefinition of republicanism. as diggins explains lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself. john patrick diggins the lost soul of american politics virtue selfinterest and the foundations of liberalism 1986 p. 307. foner 1970 p. 215 noted that lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism. jaffa 2000 p. 399 stresses lincolns emphasis on the declaration of independence as what lincoln called the sheet anchor of republicanism. see also mcpherson 1992 pp.6164.. abraham lincoln was born on february 12 1809 to thomas lincoln and nancy hanks two uneducated farmers. lincoln was born in a oneroom log cabin on the sinking spring farm in southeast hardin county kentucky now part of larue county. this area was at the time considered the frontier. the name abraham was chosen to commemorate his grandfather who was killed in an american indian raid in 1786. donald 1995 p 21 his elder sister sarah lincoln was born in 1807 a younger brother thomas jr died in infancy. it is sometimes debated whether lincoln had marfan syndrome an autosomal dominant disorder of the connective tissue characterized by long limbs and great physical stature. marfan syndrome introduction aug 1 2006. symbolic log cabin at abraham lincoln birthplace

cash and assumption of a debt. the farm site is now preserved as part of abraham lincoln birthplace national historic site. the family belonged to a baptist church that had seceded from a larger church over the issue of slavery. though lincoln was exposed to his parents antislavery sentiment from a very young age he never joined their church or any other church for that matter. as a youth he had little use for religion. life of abraham lincoln colonel ward h. lamon 1872 portions reprinted in chapter viii abraham lincoln deist and admirer of thomas paine from the book religious beliefs of our presidents by franklin steiner 1936. lincoln was just seven years old when in 1816 the family was forced to make a new start in perry county now in spencer county indiana. he later noted that this move was partly on account of slavery and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in kentucky unlike land in the northwest territory kentucky never had a proper u.s. survey and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property. lincoln was only nine when his mother then thirtyfour years old died of milk sickness. soon afterwards his father remarried to sarah bush johnston. sarah lincoln raised young lincoln like one of her own children. years later she compared lincoln to her own son saying both were good boys but i must say both now being dead that abe was the best boy i ever saw or ever expect to see. lincoln was affectionate toward his stepmother whom he would call mother for the rest of his life but he was distant from his father. donald 1995 pp. 28 152.. in 1830 after more economic and landtitle difficulties in indiana the family settled on public land ref in macon county illinois. some scholars believe that it was his fathers repeated landtitle difficulties and ensuing financial hardships that led young lincoln to study law. the following winter was desolate and especially brutal and the family considered moving back to indiana. the following year when his father relocated the family to a new homestead in coles county illinois twentytwoyearold lincoln struck out on his own canoeing down the sangamon river to the village of new salem in sangamon county. later that year hired by new salem businessman denton offutt and accompanied by friends he took goods from new salem to new orleans via flatboat on the sangamon illinois and mississippi rivers. while in new orleans he may have witnessed a slave auction though as a frequent visitor to kentucky he would have had several earlier opportunities to witness similar sales. donald 1995 ch. 2.. lincolns formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling. largely selfeducated he read every book he could get his hands on once walking. just to borrow one while his favorite book was the life of george washington lincoln mastered the bible shakespeare and english and american history and developed a plain writing style that puzzled audiences more used to grandiose rhetoric. he was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an ax some rails he had allegedly split in his youth were exhibited at the 1860 republican national convention as the party celebrated the poorboymadegood theme. lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals even for food. though he was unusually tall at 4 inches and strong lincoln spent so much time reading that some neighbors suspected he must be doing it to avoid strenuous manual labor.. young abraham lincoln. lincoln began his political career in 1832 at age 23 with an unsuccessful campaign for the illinois general assembly as a member of the whig party. he ran eighth in a field of 13 candidates. the centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the sangamon river. he believed that this would attract steamboat traffic which would allow the sparsely populated poorer areas along the river to flourish.. he was elected captain of an illinois militia company drawn from new salem during the black hawk war and later wrote that he had not had any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction. thomas 1952 3234 basler 1946 p. 551 though he never saw

for several months lincoln ran a small store in new salem selling tea coffee sugar salt blue calico brown muslin straw hats and whiskey. beveridge 1928 11278 later he found work as village postmaster and as a surveyor.. in 1834 he won election to the state legislature and after coming across the commentaries on the laws of england began to teach himself law. admitted to the bar in 1837 he moved to springfield illinois that same year and began to practice law with john t. stuart. with a reputation as a formidable adversary during crossexaminations and in his closing arguments lincoln became one of the most respected and successful lawyers in illinois and grew steadily more prosperous.. he served four successive terms in the illinois house of representatives as a representative from sangamon county and became a leader of the illinois whig party. in 1837 he made his first protest against slavery in the illinois house stating that the institution was founded on both injustice and bad policy. protest in illinois legislature on slavery p.75 march 3 1837 it was also in this same year that lincoln met joshua fry speed who would become his most intimate friend.. lincoln wrote a series of anonymous letters published in 1842 in the sangamon journal mocking state auditor and prominent democrat james shields. shields would later become a u.s. senator but when he learned that it was lincoln who had been writing the barbs he challenged him to a duel. as shields was the challenger lincoln was granted the right to choose the weapon and specified cavalry broad swords of the largest size. much taller and with long arms this gave him an overwhelming advantage over his opponent however the duel was called off at the last minute. beveridge 1928 1349. lincoln had been practicing with the broad sword. two years later lincoln entered law practice with william herndon a fellow whig. in 1854 both men joined the fledgling republican party. following lincolns death herndon began collecting stories about lincoln and published them in herndons lincoln.. the first photograph ever taken of mary lincoln a daguerreotype by shepherd in 1846.. on november 4 1842 lincoln married mary

photograph ever taken of abraham lincoln a daguerreotype taken by shepherd in 1846.. a whig and an admirer of party leader henry clay lincoln was elected to a term in the u.s. house of representatives in 1846. as a freshman house member he was not a particularly powerful or influential figure. he spoke out against the mexicanamerican war which he attributed to president polks desire for military glory that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood. he also challenged the presidents claims regarding the texas boundary and offered spot resolutions demanding to know on what spot on us soil that blood was first spilt. congressional globe 30th session 1848 pp.9395 in january of 1848 he was among the 82 whigs who defeated 81 democrats in a procedural vote on an amendment to send a routine resolution back to committee with instructions to add the words a war unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the president of the united states. the amendment passed but the bill never reemerged from committee and was never finally voted upon. house journal 30th session 1848 pp.183184. lincoln later damaged his political reputation with a speech in which he declared god of heaven has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men women and children and lay waste and pillage the land of the just. two weeks later president polk sent a peace treaty to congress. while no one in washington paid any attention to lincoln the democrats orchestrated angry outbursts from across his district where the war was popular and many had volunteered. in morgan county resolutions were adopted in fervent support of the war and in wrathful denunciation of the treasonable assaults of guerrillas at home party demagogues slanderers of the president defenders of the butchery at the alamo traducers of the heroism at san jacinto. abe lincoln resource page. warned by his law partner william herndon that the damage was mounting and irreparable lincoln decided not to run for reelection. in fact in 1848 he campaigned vigorously for zachary taylor the successful general whose atrocities he had denounced in january. regardless his statements were not easily forgotten and would haunt him during the civil war. these statements were also held against him when he applied for a position in the new taylor administration. instead taylors people offered lincoln various positions in the remote oregon territory primarily the governorship. acceptance of this offer would have ended his career in the rapidly growing state of illinois so lincoln declined the position. returning to springfield lincoln gave up politics for several years and turned his energies to his law practice. during this time he made many trips on horseback between various counties courthouses. beveridge 1928 1 42833 donald 1995 p. 14043.. in the 1920s historical markers were placed at the county lines along the route lincoln traveled in the eight judicial district. this example is on the border of piatt and dewitt counties. by the mid1850s lincolns caseload focused largely on the competing transportation interests of river barges and railroads. in one prominent 1851 case he represented the alton sangamon railroad in a dispute with a shareholder james a. barret. barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to the railroad on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest that the newer route proposed by alton sangamon was superior and less expensive and that accordingly the corporation had a right to sue barret for his delinquent payment. he won this case and the decision by the illinois supreme court was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the united states. donald 1995 ch. 6.. possibly the most notable criminal trial of lincolns career as a lawyer came in 1858 when he defended william duff armstrong who has been charged with murder. the case became famous for lincolns use of judicial noticea rare tactic at that timeto show that an eyewitness had lied on the stand. after the witness testified to having seen the crime by moonlight lincoln produced a farmers almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle that it could not have provided enough illumination to see anything clearly. based almost entirely on this evidence armstrong was acquitted. donald 1995 15051. lincoln was involved in more than 5100 cases in illinois alone during his 23year legal career. though many of these cases involved little more than filing a writ others were more substantial and quite involved. lincoln and his partners appeared before the illinois state supreme court more than 400 times. during one trial lincolns voir dire included a question to prospective jurors as to whether they were acquainted with counsel for the other side. when a few of them turned out to know the other lawyer the judge interrupted saying mr. lincoln you are wasting the time of the court. the fact that a prospective juror knows your opponent does not disqualify him.. no your honor i understand that lincoln answered. im afraid that some of them might not know him which would place me at a disadvantage.. lincoln returned to politics in response to the kansasnebraska act 1854 which expressly repealed the limits on slaverys extent as determined by the missouri compromise 1820. illinois democrat stephen a. douglas the most powerful man in the senate proposed popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse and incorporated it into the kansasnebraska act. douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory rather than have such a decision imposed on them by congress. donald 1995 ch. 7.. in a speech against the act on october 16 1854 delivered in peoria lincoln first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day. drawing on remnants of the old whig free soil liberty and democratic parties he was instrumental in forming the new republican party. in a stirring campaign the republicans carried illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. lincoln was the obvious choice but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an exdemocrat lyman trumbull.. in 185758 douglas broke with president buchanan leading to a fight for control of the democratic party. some eastern republicans even favored the reelection of douglas in 1858 since he had led the opposition to the lecompton constitution which would have admitted kansas as a slave state. accepting the republican nomination for senate in 1858 lincoln delivered his famous speech a house divided against itself cannot stand.mark 325 i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided. it will become all one thing or all the other. a house divided against itself cannot stand june 1858 the speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate and rallied republicans across the north.. the 1858 campaign featured the lincolndouglas debates a nationally famous contest on slavery. lincoln warned that the slave power was threatening the values of republicanism while douglas emphasized the supremacy of democracy as set forth in his freeport doctrine which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not. though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature reelected douglas to the senate. nevertheless lincolns eloquence transformed him into a national political star.. during the debates of 1858 the issue of race was often discussed. during a time period when few believed in racial egalitarianism stephen douglas informed the crowds if you desire negro citizenship if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves then support mr. lincoln and the black republican party who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro. first debate with stephen a. douglas at ottawa illinois august 21 1858 lincoln countered that he was not in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races. fourth debate with stephen a. douglas at charleston illinois september 18 1858 his opposition to slavery was opposition to the slave power though this would change during the course of the civil war. donald 1995 ch. 8.. on may 910 1860 the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur. at this convention lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.. the rail candidate lincolns 1860 candidacy is held up by slavery issue slave on left and party organization new york tribune editor horace greeley on right. photo of lincoln taken february 27 1860 in new york city by mathew brady the day of his famous cooper union speech.. entering the presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog lincoln was eventually chosen as the republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. his expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals william h. seward and salmon p. chase. his western origins also appealed to the newer states other contenders especially those with more governmental experience had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states while lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the west. most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party as the slave power tightened its grasp on the national government. yet despite his southern connections his inlaws owned slaves lincoln misunderstood the depth of the revolution underway in the south and the emergence of southern nationalism. throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession. gabor s. boritt and the war came? abraham lincoln and the question of individual responsibility why the civil war came ed by boritt 1996 pp 330.. throughout the election lincoln did not campaign or give speeches. this was handled by the state and county republican organizations who used the latest techniques to sustain party enthusiasm and thus obtain high turnout. there was little effort to convert nonrepublicans and there was virtually no campaigning in the south except for a few border cities such as st. louis missouri and wheeling virginia indeed the party did not even run a slate in most of the south. in the north there were thousands of republican speakers tons of campaign posters and leaflets and thousands of newspaper editorials. these focused first on the party platform and second on lincolns life story making the most of his boyhood poverty his pioneer background his native genius and his rise from obscurity. his nicknames honest abe and the railsplitter were exploited to the full. the goal was to emphasize the superior power of free labor whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. thomas 1952 p 216 reinhard h. luthin the first lincoln campaign 1944 nevins vol 4. on november 6 1860 lincoln was elected as the 16th president of the united states beating democrat stephen a. douglas john c. breckinridge of the southern democrats and john bell of the new constitutional union party. he was the first republican president winning entirely on the strength of his support in the north he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the south and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other southern states. lincoln gained 1865908 votes 39.9 of the total for 180 electoral votes douglas 1380202 29.5 for 12 electoral votes breckenridge 848019 18.1 for 72 electoral votes and bell 590901 12.5 for 39 electoral votes. there were fusion tickets in some states but even if his opponents had combined in every state lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election.. as lincolns election became more likely secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the union. south carolina took the lead followed by six other cottongrowing states in the deep south. the upper south delaware maryland virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri and arkansas listened to and rejected the secessionist appeal. they decided to stay in the union though they warned lincoln that they would not support an invasion through their territory. the seven confederate states seceded before lincoln took office declaring themselves to be a new nation the confederate states of america. president buchanan and presidentelect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy.. presidentelect lincoln evaded possible assassins in baltimore and on february 23 1861 arrived in disguise in washington d.c. at his inauguration on march 4 1861 the german american turners formed lincolns bodyguard and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present ready to protect the capital from confederate invasion and local insurrection.. photograph showing the march 4 1861 inauguration of abraham lincoln in front of united states capitol.. in his first inaugural address lincoln declared i hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution the union of these states is perpetual. perpetuity is implied if not expressed in the fundamental law of all national governments arguing further that the purpose of the united states constitution was to form a more perfect union than the articles of confederation which were explicitly perpetual thus the constitution too was perpetual. he asked rhetorically that even were the constitution a simple contract would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?. also in his inaugural address in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war lincoln supported the pending corwin amendment to the constitution which had already passed congress. this amendment which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it existed was designed to appeal not to the confederacy but to the critical border states. at the same time lincoln adamantly opposed the crittenden compromise which would have permitted slavery in the territories. despite support for the crittenden compromise among some prominent republicans including william seward lincoln denounced it saying that it would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people tribe and state owning a foot of land between here and tierra del fuego.. by the time lincoln took office the confederacy was an established fact and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the union on any terms. no compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. lincoln might have allowed the southern states to secede and some republicans recommended that. however conservative democratic nationalists such as jeremiah s. black joseph holt and edwin m. stanton had taken control of buchanans cabinet around january 1 1861 and refused to accept secession. lincoln and nearly every republican leader adopted this position by march 1861 the union could not be dismantled. however as a strict follower of the constitution lincoln refused to take any action against the south unless the unionists themselves were attacked first. this finally happened in april 1861.. historian allan nevins argues that lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the union hold government property and still avoid war. he temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis overestimated the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and border states and misunderstood the conditional support of unionists in the border states. allan nevins the improvised war 18611862 1959 p 29. in april 1861 after union troops at fort sumter were fired upon and forced to surrender lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75000 troops to recapture forts protect the capital and preserve the union which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. virginia which had repeatedly warned lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state responded by seceding along with north carolina tennessee and arkansas.. the slave states of missouri kentucky maryland and delaware did not secede and lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there promising not to interfere with slavery. after the fighting started he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas especially in maryland and held in military prisons without trial. over 18000 were arrested though none were executed. one clement vallandigham was exiled but all of the remainder were released usually after two or three months see ex parte merryman.. lincoln met with his cabinet for the first reading of the emancipation proclamation draft on july 22 1862. lr edwin m. stanton salmon p. chase abraham lincoln gideon welles caleb b. smith william h. seward montgomery blair and edward bates. in july 1862 congress moved to free the slaves by passing the second confiscation act. the goal was to weaken the rebellion which was led and controlled by slave owners. while it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery the thirteenth amendment did that the act showed that lincoln had the support of congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. this new law was implemented with lincolns emancipation proclamation.. lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the united states. in 1861 1862 however he made it clear that the north was fighting the war to preserve the union not to abolish slavery. freeing the slaves became in late 1862 a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. abolitionists criticized lincoln for his sluggishness over slavery per se but on august 22 1862 lincoln explained. the emancipation proclamation announced on september 22 and put into effect on january 1 1863 freed slaves in territories not under union control. as union armies advanced south more slaves were liberated until all of them in confederate hands over three million were freed. lincoln later said i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper. the proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the thirteenth amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation. lincoln addressed the issue of his consistency in an 1864 letter to albert g. hodges. letter to albert g. hodges april 4 1864. in september 1862 thirteen northern governors met in altoona pennsylvania at the loyal war governors conference to discuss the proclamation and union war effort. in the end the state executives fully supported the presidents proclamation and also suggested the removal of general george b. mcclellan as commander of the unions army of the potomac. images of america altoona by sr. anne francis pulling 2001 10.. for some time lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. he commented favorably on colonization in the emancipation proclamation but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. as frederick douglass observed lincoln was the first great man that i talked with in the united states freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself of the difference of color. life and times of frederick douglass by frederick douglass 1895. after union victories at gettysburg vicksburg and chattanooga in 1863 victory seemed at hand and lincoln promoted ulysses s. grant generalinchief march 12 1864. when the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates lincoln supported grants strategy of wearing down lees confederate army at the cost of heavy union casualties. with an election looming he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. at the convention the republican party selected andrew johnson a war democrat from the southern state of tennessee as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. they ran on the new union party ticket uniting republicans and war democrats.. lincoln in top hat with allan pinkerton and gen. john alexander mcclernand at antietam.. nevertheless republicans across the country feared that lincoln would be defeated. acknowledging this fear lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that if he should lose the election he would nonetheless defeat the confederacy by an allout military effort before turning over the white house mark grimsley and brooks d simpson eds. the collapse of the confederacy 2001 p 80. lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.. while the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war a failure their candidate general george b. mcclellan supported the war and repudiated the platform.. lincoln provided grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to support grant and win local support for the war effort. shermans capture of atlanta in september ended defeatist jitters the democratic party was deeply split with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln the union party was united and energized and lincoln was easily reelected in a landslide. he won all but two states capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.. on march 4 1865 lincoln delivered his second inaugural address his favorite of all his speeches. at this time a victory over the rebels was at hand slavery was dead and lincoln was looking to the future.. running the machine. an 1864 cartoon featuring lincoln william fessenden edwin stanton william seward and gideon welles takes a swing at the lincoln administration. the war was a source of constant frustration for the president and occupied nearly all of his time. he had a contentious relationship with general mcclellan who became generalinchief of all the union armies in the wake of the embarrassing union defeat at the first battle of bull run and after the retirement of winfield scott in late 1861. despite his inexperience in military affairs lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. his priorities were twofold to ensure that washington d.c. was well defended and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the northern public and press. mcclellan a youthful west point graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service took a more cautious approach. he took several months to plan and execute his peninsula campaign with the objective of capturing richmond by moving the army of the potomac by boat to the peninsula between the james and york rivers. mcclellans delay irritated lincoln as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend washington d.c. lincoln insisted on holding some of mcclellans troops to defend the capital a decision mcclellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the peninsula campaign.. mcclellan a lifelong democrat who was temperamentally conservative was relieved as generalinchief after releasing his harrisons landing letter where he offered unsolicited political advice to lincoln urging caution in the war effort. mcclellans letter incensed radical republicans who successfully pressured lincoln to appoint john pope a republican as head of the new army of virginia. pope complied with lincolns strategic desire to move toward richmond from the north thus protecting the capital from attack. but pope was soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of 1862 forcing the army of the potomac to defend washington for a second time. in response to his failure pope was sent to minnesota to fight the sioux.. an 1864 mathew brady photo depicts president lincoln reading a book with his youngest son tad. panicked by lees invasion of maryland lincoln restored mcclellan to command of all forces around washington in time for the battle of antietam september 1862. the ensuing union victory enabled lincoln to release his emancipation proclamation but he relieved mcclellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed republican ambrose burnside to head the army of the potomac. burnside had promised to follow through on lincolns strategic vision for a strong offensive against lee and richmond. after burnside was stunningly defeated at fredericksburg joseph hooker was given the command despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders. joseph hooker biography hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville may 1863 and relieved of command early in the subsequent gettysburg campaign replaced by george meade.. after the union victory at gettysburg meades failure to pursue lee and months of inactivity for the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln to bring in a western general ulysses s. grant. grant already had a solid string of victories in the western theater including the battles of vicksburg and chattanooga. responding to criticism of grant lincoln was quoted as saying i cannot spare this man. he fights. grant waged his bloody overland campaign in 1864 with a strategy of a war of attrition characterized by high union losses at battles such as the wilderness and cold harbor but by proportionately higher confederate losses. his invasion campaign eventually bottled lee up in the siege of petersburg so that grant could take richmond and bring the war to a close in the spring of 1865.. lincoln authorized grant to target civilians and infrastructure hoping to destroy the souths morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. this allowed generals sherman and sheridan to destroy farms and towns in the shenandoah valley georgia and south carolina. the damage caused by shermans march to the sea through georgia totaled in excess of 100 million by shermans own estimate. see hofstadter richard the united states the history of a republic prenticehall 1967 p. 446.. lincoln had a starcrossed record as a military leader possessing a keen understanding of strategic points such as the mississippi river and the fortress city of vicksburg and the importance of defeating the enemys army rather than simply capturing cities. he had however limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863 when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in ulysses s. grant. only then could he insist on using african american troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.. throughout the war lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. he spent hours at the war department telegraph office reading dispatches from his generals. he visited battle sites frequently and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. during jubal anderson earlys raid on washington d.c. in 1864 lincoln had to be told to duck to avoid being shot while observing the battle.. reconstruction began during the war as lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the southern states and what to do with confederate leaders and the freed slaves. lincoln led the moderates regarding reconstructionist policy and was usually opposed by the radical republicans under thaddeus stevens in the house and charles sumner and benjamin wade in the senate though he cooperated with these men on most other issues. determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the south lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind union lines. his amnesty proclamation of december 8 1863 offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office had not mistreated union prisoners and would sign an oath of allegiance. ref critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. of special importance were tennessee where lincoln appointed andrew johnson as governor and louisiana where lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. the radicals thought this policy too lenient and passed their own plan the wadedavis bill in 1864. when lincoln pocketvetoed the bill the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from louisiana arkansas and tennessee. donald 1995 ch. 20. on april 9 1865 lee surrendered at appomattox court house in virginia and the war was effectively over. the other rebel armies surrendered soon after and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare. lincoln went to richmond to make a public gesture of sitting at jefferson daviss own desk symbolically saying to the nation that the president of the united states held authority over the entire land. he was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirers quote i know i am free for i have seen the face of father abraham and have felt him. when a general asked lincoln how the defeated confederates should be treated lincoln replied let em up easy. donald 1995 576 580 president lincoln enters richmond 1865 eyewitness to history www.eywitnesstohistory.com 2000.. one of the last photographs of lincoln likely taken between february and april 1865. lincolns powerful rhetoric defined the issues of the war for the nation the world and posterity. his extraordinary command of the english language was evidenced in the gettysburg address a speech dedicating the cemetery at gettysburg that he delivered on november 19 1863. the speech defied lincolns own prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here. lincolns second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted. in these speeches lincoln articulated better than anyone else the rationale behind the union cause.. in recent years historians have stressed lincolns use of and redefinition of republican values. as early as the 1850s a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the constitution lincoln shifted emphasis to the declaration of independence as the foundation of american political valueswhat he called the sheet anchor of republicanism. jaffa 2000 p. 399 the declarations emphasis on freedom and equality for all rather than the constitutions tolerance of slavers shifted the debate. as diggins concludes regarding the highly influential cooper union speech lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself. john patrick diggins the lost soul of american politics virtue selfinterest and the foundations of liberalism 1986 p. 307. his position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism rather than its legalisms. foner 1970 p. 215 says lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism. see also mcpherson 1992 pp.6164. nevertheless in 1861 lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms the constitution was a contract and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state. jaffa 2000 p. 263 that duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in reconstruction.. lincolns second inauguration on march 4 1865. in the photo lincolns assassin john wilkes booth can be seen in the crowd at the top and accomplices david herold lewis powell george atzerodt john surratt and edmund spangler in the bottom crowd. in his gettysburg address lincoln redefined the american nation arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776 conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. he declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth. by emphasizing the centrality of the nation he rebuffed the claims of state sovereignty. while some critics say lincoln moved too far and too fast h.l. mencken said it is difficult to imagine anything more untrue. the union soldiers in the battle actually fought against selfdetermination it was the confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves. mencken did not mention the right of selfdetermination rights for blacks. they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked a new founding of the nation. wills 1992 p. 39.. during the civil war lincoln appropriated powers no previous president had wielded he used his war powers to proclaim a blockade suspended the writ of habeas corpus spent money without congressional authorization and imprisoned 18000 suspected confederate sympathizers without trial. nearly all of his actions although vehemently denounced by the copperheads were subsequently upheld by congress and the courts.. lincoln believed in the whig theory of the presidency which left congress to write the laws while he signed them vetoing only those bills that threatened his war powers. thus he signed the homestead act in 1862 making millions of acres of governmentheld land in the west available for purchase at very low cost. the morrill landgrant colleges act also signed in 1862 provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state. the pacific railway acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the united states first transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869. other important legislation involved economic matters including the first income tax and higher tariffs. also included was the creation of the system of national banks by the national banking acts of 1863 1864 and 1865 which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system. congress created and lincoln approved the department of agriculture in 1862 although that institution would not become a cabinetlevel department until 1889.. the legal tender act of 1862 established the united states note the first paper currency in united states history. this was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.. during the war lincolns treasury department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied souththe most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.. in

dying of his wounds soon after.. an army surgeon doctor charles leale initially assessed lincolns wound as mortal. the president was taken across the street from the theater to the petersen house where he lay in a coma for nine hours before he died. several physicians attended lincoln including u.s. army surgeon general joseph k. barnes of the army medical museum. using a probe barnes located some fragments of lincolns skull and the ball lodged 6 inches 15 cm inside his brain. lincoln never regained consciousness and was officially pronounced dead at 72210 a.m. april 15 1865 at the age of 56. there is some disagreement among historians as to stantons words after lincoln died. all agree that he began now he belongs to the... with some stating he said ages while others believe he said angels. after lincolns body was returned to the white house his body was prepared for his lying in repose in the east room. he was the first president to lie in state.. the army medical museum now

of his son william 1654 miles 2661 km to illinois . lincolns body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to illinois. while much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the united states copperheads celebrated the death of a man they considered an unconstitutional tyrant. the lincoln tomb in oak ridge cemetery in springfield is 177 feet 54 m tall and by 1874 was surmounted with several bronze statues of lincoln. to prevent repeated attempts to steal lincolns body and hold it for ransom robert todd lincoln had lincoln exhumed and reinterred in concrete several feet thick in 1901.. with over 120 photographs taken of him lincoln was the most photographed man in the united states up to the time he was assassinated.. lincoln was known for appointing political rivals to high positions in his cabinet to keep in line all factions of his party and to let them battle each other and not combine against lincoln. historians agree that except for simon cameron it was a highly effective group.. abraham lincolns official white house portrait. lincoln appointed the following justices to the supreme court of the united states. in march 1860 in a speech in new haven connecticut lincoln said with respect to slavery whenever this question shall be settled it must be settled on some philosophical basis. no policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained. the philosophical basis for lincolns beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that lincoln be examined seriously as a man of ideas. lincoln was a strong supporter of the american whig version of liberal capitalism who more than most politicians of the time was able to express his ideas within the context of nineteenth century religious beliefs. guelzo pg. 1819. there were few people who strongly or directly influenced lincolns moral and intellectual development and perspectives. there was no teacher mentor church leader community leader or peer that lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. lacking a formal education lincolns personal philosophy was shaped by an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning. it was lincolns reading rather than his relationships that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs. guelzo pg. 20. miller pg. 5759 lincolns reading and study of the bible was an integral part of his intellectual roots.. lincoln did even as a boy largely reject organized religion but the calvinistic doctrine of necessity would remain a factor throughout his life. in 1846 lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as that the human mind is impelled to action or held in rest by some power over which the mind itself has no control. donald pg. 15. the quote came from a letter to the public in which lincoln was denying charges by a political opponent that he was a religious scoffer. in april 1864 in justifying his actions in regard to emancipation lincoln wrote i claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me. now at the end of three years struggle the nations condition is not what either party or any man devised or expected. god alone can claim it. donald pg. 514. as lincoln matured and especially during his term as president the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. on a personal level the death of his son willie in february 1862 may have caused lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace. wilson pg. 251254 after willies death in the summer or early fall of 1862 lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why from a divine standpoint the severity of the war was necessary. lincolns religious skepticism was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the lockean enlightenment and classical liberalism especially economic liberalism. guelzo pg. 20 consistent with the common practice of the whig party lincoln would often use the declaration of independence as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies. guelzo pg.194 in a february 22 1861 speech at independence hall in philadelphia lincoln said. he found in the declaration justification for whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the nativist platform of the know nothings. in claiming that all men were created free lincoln and the whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement expanded education territory to grow and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population. guelzo pg.194195. it was the declaration of independence rather than the bible that lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. he saw the declaration as more than a political document. to him as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders it was foremost a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation. miller pg. 297. while lincoln is usually portrayed bearded he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11yearold grace bedell. lincolns death made the president a martyr to many. repeated polls of historians have ranked lincoln as among the greatest presidents in u.s. history often appearing in the first position. among contemporary admirers lincoln is usually seen as personifying classical values of honesty and integrity as well as respect for individual and minority rights and human freedom in general.. many american organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image with interests ranging from the gay rightssupporting log cabin republicans to the insurance corporation lincoln national corporation. the lincoln automobile is also named after him. the ballistic missile submarine abraham lincoln ssbn602 and the aircraft carrier abraham lincoln cvn72 were named in his honor. also the liberty ship ss nancy hanks was named to honor his mother. during the spanish civil war the american faction of the international brigades named themselves the abraham lincoln brigade after lincoln.. lincoln has been memorialized in many city names notably the capital of nebraska. lincoln illinois is the only city to be named

outspoken opponent of the expansion of slavery in the united states in his short autobiography written for the 1860 presidential campaign lincoln would describe his protest in the illinois legislature as one that briefly defined his position on the slavery question and so far as it goes it was then the same that it is now. this was in reference to the antiexpansion sentiments he had then expressed.

political culture rhetorical opportunity technological innovation and human genius and it brought abraham lincoln to the center stage of american politics at precisely the right time and place and with precisely the right message that slavery was wrong and ought to be confined to the areas where it already existed and placed on the course of ultimate extinction... . lincoln won the republican party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year. during his term he helped preserve the united states by leading the defeat of the secessionist confederate states of america in the american civil war. he introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery issuing his emancipation proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the thirteenth amendment to the constitution in 1865.. lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort especially the selection of top generals including ulysses s. grant. historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the republican party well bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. lincoln successfully defused a war scare with the united kingdom in 1861. under his leadership the union took control of the border slave states at the start of the war. additionally he managed his own reelection in the 1864 presidential election.. opponents of the war also known as copperheads criticized him for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. conversely the radical republicans an abolitionist faction of the republican party criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. even with these problems lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches his gettysburg address is but one example of this. at the close of the war lincoln held a moderate view of reconstruction seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. his assassination in 1865 was the first presidential assassination in u.s. history and made him a martyr for the ideal of national unity.. scholars now rank lincoln among the top three u.s. presidents with the majority of those surveyed placing him first. he is noted

had difficulties proving title to their property. lincoln was only nine when his mother then thirtyfour years old died of milk sickness. soon afterwards his father remarried to sarah bush johnston.

river barges and railroads. in one prominent 1851 case he represented the alton sangamon railroad in a dispute with a shareholder james a. barret. barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to the railroad on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest that the newer route proposed by alton sangamon was superior and less expensive and that accordingly the corporation had a right to sue barret for his delinquent payment. he won this case and the decision by the illinois supreme court was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the united states. donald 1995 ch. 6.. possibly the most notable criminal trial of lincolns career as a lawyer came in 1858 when he defended william duff armstrong who has been charged with murder. the case became famous for lincolns use of judicial noticea rare tactic at that timeto show that an eyewitness had lied on the stand. after the witness testified to having seen the crime by moonlight lincoln produced a farmers almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle that it could not have provided enough illumination to see anything clearly. based almost entirely on this evidence armstrong was acquitted. donald 1995 15051. lincoln was involved in more than 5100 cases in illinois alone during his 23year legal career. though many of these cases involved little more than filing a writ others were more substantial and quite involved. lincoln and his partners appeared before the illinois state supreme court more than 400 times. during one trial lincolns voir dire included a question to prospective jurors as to whether they were acquainted with counsel for the other side. when a few of them turned out to know the other lawyer the judge interrupted saying mr. lincoln you are wasting the time of the court. the fact that a prospective juror knows your opponent does not disqualify him.. no your honor i understand that lincoln answered. im afraid that some of them might not know him which would place me at a disadvantage.. lincoln returned to politics in response to the kansasnebraska act 1854 which expressly repealed the limits on slaverys extent as determined by the missouri compromise 1820. illinois democrat stephen a. douglas the most powerful man in the senate proposed popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse and incorporated it into the kansasnebraska act. douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory rather than have such a decision imposed on them by congress. donald 1995 ch. 7.. in a speech against the act on october 16 1854 delivered in peoria lincoln first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day. drawing on remnants of the old whig free soil liberty and democratic parties he was instrumental in forming the new republican party. in a stirring campaign the republicans carried illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. lincoln was the obvious choice but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an exdemocrat lyman trumbull.. in 185758 douglas broke with president buchanan leading to a fight for control of the democratic party. some eastern republicans even favored the reelection of douglas in 1858 since he had led the opposition to the lecompton constitution which would have admitted kansas as a slave state. accepting the republican nomination for senate in 1858 lincoln delivered his famous speech a house divided against itself cannot stand.mark 325 i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided. it will become all one thing or all the other. a house divided against itself cannot stand june 1858 the speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate and rallied republicans across the north.. the 1858 campaign featured the lincolndouglas debates a nationally famous contest on slavery. lincoln warned that the slave power was threatening the values of republicanism while douglas emphasized the supremacy of democracy as set forth in his freeport doctrine which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not. though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature reelected douglas to the senate. nevertheless lincolns eloquence transformed him into a national political star.. during the debates of 1858 the issue of race was often discussed. during a time period when few believed in racial egalitarianism stephen douglas informed the crowds if you desire negro citizenship if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves then support mr. lincoln and the black republican party who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro. first debate with stephen a. douglas at ottawa illinois august 21 1858 lincoln countered that he was not in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races. fourth debate with stephen a. douglas at charleston illinois september 18 1858 his opposition to slavery was opposition to the slave power though this would change during the course of the civil war. donald 1995 ch. 8.. on may 910 1860 the illinois republican state

entering the presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog lincoln was eventually chosen as the republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. his expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals william h. seward and salmon p. chase. his western origins also appealed to the newer states other contenders especially those with more governmental experience had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states while lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the west. most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party as the slave power tightened its grasp on the national government. yet despite his southern connections his inlaws owned slaves lincoln misunderstood the depth of the revolution underway in the south and the emergence of southern nationalism. throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession. gabor s. boritt and the war came? abraham lincoln and the question of individual responsibility why the civil war came ed by boritt 1996 pp 330.. throughout the election lincoln did not campaign or give speeches. this was handled by the state and county republican organizations who used the latest techniques to sustain party enthusiasm and thus obtain high turnout. there was little effort to convert nonrepublicans and there was virtually no campaigning in the south except for a few border cities such as st. louis missouri and wheeling virginia indeed the party did not even run a slate in most of the south. in the north there were thousands of republican speakers tons of campaign posters and leaflets and thousands of newspaper editorials. these focused first on the party platform and second on lincolns life story making the most of his boyhood poverty his pioneer background his native genius and his rise from obscurity. his nicknames honest abe and the railsplitter were exploited to the full. the goal was to emphasize the superior power of free labor whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. thomas 1952 p 216 reinhard h. luthin the first lincoln campaign 1944 nevins vol 4. on november 6 1860 lincoln was elected as the 16th president of the united states beating democrat stephen a. douglas john c. breckinridge of the southern democrats and john bell of the new constitutional union party. he was the first republican president winning entirely on the strength of his support in the north he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the south and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other southern states. lincoln gained 1865908 votes 39.9 of the total for 180 electoral votes douglas 1380202 29.5 for 12 electoral votes breckenridge 848019 18.1 for 72 electoral votes and bell 590901 12.5 for 39 electoral votes. there were fusion tickets in some states but even if his opponents had combined in every state lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election.. as lincolns election became more likely secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the union. south carolina took the lead followed by six other cottongrowing states in the deep south. the upper south delaware maryland virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri and arkansas listened to and rejected the secessionist appeal. they decided to stay in the union though they warned lincoln that they would not support an invasion through their territory. the seven confederate states seceded before lincoln took office declaring themselves to be a new nation the confederate states of america. president buchanan and presidentelect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy.. presidentelect lincoln evaded possible assassins in baltimore and on february 23 1861 arrived in disguise in washington d.c. at his inauguration on march 4 1861 the german american turners formed lincolns bodyguard and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present ready to protect the capital from confederate invasion and local insurrection.. photograph showing the march 4 1861 inauguration of abraham lincoln in front of united states capitol.. in his first inaugural address lincoln declared i hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution the union of these states is perpetual. perpetuity is implied if not expressed in the fundamental law of all national governments arguing further that the purpose of the united states constitution was to form a more perfect union than the articles of confederation which were explicitly perpetual thus the constitution too was perpetual. he asked rhetorically that even were the constitution a simple contract would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?. also in his inaugural address in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war lincoln supported the pending corwin amendment to the constitution which had already passed congress. this amendment which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it existed was designed to appeal not to the confederacy but to the critical border states. at the same time lincoln adamantly opposed the crittenden compromise which would have permitted slavery in the territories. despite support for the crittenden compromise among some prominent republicans including william seward lincoln denounced it saying that it would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people tribe and state owning a foot of land between here and tierra del fuego.. by the time lincoln took office the confederacy was an established fact and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the union on any terms. no compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. lincoln might have allowed the southern states to secede and some republicans recommended that. however conservative democratic nationalists such as jeremiah s. black joseph holt and edwin m. stanton had taken control of buchanans cabinet around january 1 1861 and refused to accept secession. lincoln and nearly every republican leader adopted this position by march 1861 the union could not be dismantled. however as a strict follower of the constitution lincoln refused to take any action against the south unless the unionists themselves were attacked first. this finally happened in april 1861.. historian allan nevins argues that lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the union hold government property and still avoid war. he temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis overestimated the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and border states and misunderstood the conditional support of unionists in the border states. allan nevins the improvised war 18611862 1959 p 29. in april 1861 after union troops at fort sumter were fired upon and forced to surrender lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75000 troops to recapture forts protect the capital and preserve the union which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. virginia which had repeatedly warned lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state responded by seceding along with north carolina tennessee and arkansas.. the slave states of missouri kentucky maryland and delaware did not secede and lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there promising not to interfere with slavery. after the fighting started he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas especially in maryland and held in military prisons without trial. over 18000 were arrested though none were executed. one clement vallandigham was exiled but all of the remainder were released usually after two or three months see ex parte merryman.. lincoln met with his cabinet for the first reading of the emancipation proclamation draft on july 22 1862. lr edwin m. stanton salmon p. chase abraham lincoln gideon welles caleb b. smith william h. seward montgomery blair and edward bates. in july 1862 congress moved to free the slaves by passing the second confiscation act. the goal was to weaken the rebellion which was led and controlled by slave owners. while it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery the thirteenth amendment did that the act showed that lincoln had the support of congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. this new law was implemented with lincolns emancipation proclamation.. lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the united states. in 1861 1862 however he made it clear that the north was fighting the war to preserve the union not to abolish slavery. freeing the slaves became in late 1862 a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. abolitionists criticized lincoln for his sluggishness over slavery per se but on august 22 1862 lincoln explained. the emancipation proclamation announced on september 22 and put into effect on january 1 1863 freed slaves in territories not under union control. as union armies advanced south more slaves were liberated until all of them in confederate hands over three million were freed. lincoln later said i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper. the proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the thirteenth amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation. lincoln addressed the issue of his consistency in an 1864 letter to albert g. hodges. letter to albert g. hodges april 4 1864. in september 1862 thirteen northern governors met in altoona pennsylvania at the loyal war governors conference to discuss the proclamation and union war effort. in the end the state executives fully supported the presidents proclamation and also suggested the removal of general george b. mcclellan as commander of the unions army of the potomac. images of america altoona by sr. anne francis pulling 2001 10.. for some time lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. he commented favorably on colonization in the emancipation proclamation but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. as frederick douglass observed lincoln was the first great man that i talked with in the united states freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself of the difference of color. life and times of frederick douglass by frederick douglass 1895. after union victories at gettysburg vicksburg and chattanooga in 1863 victory seemed at hand and lincoln promoted ulysses s. grant generalinchief march 12 1864. when the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates lincoln supported grants strategy of wearing down lees confederate army at the cost of heavy union casualties. with an election looming he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. at the convention the republican party selected andrew johnson a war democrat from the southern state of tennessee as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. they ran on the new union party ticket uniting republicans and war democrats.. lincoln in top hat with allan pinkerton and gen. john alexander mcclernand at antietam.. nevertheless republicans across the country feared that lincoln would be defeated. acknowledging this fear lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that if he should lose the election he would nonetheless defeat the confederacy by an allout military effort before turning over the white house mark grimsley and brooks d simpson eds. the collapse of the confederacy 2001 p 80. lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.. while the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war a failure their candidate general george b. mcclellan supported the war and repudiated the platform.. lincoln provided grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to support grant and win local support for the war effort. shermans capture of atlanta in september ended defeatist jitters the democratic party was deeply split with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln the union party was united and energized and lincoln was easily reelected in a landslide. he won all but two states capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.. on march 4 1865 lincoln delivered his second inaugural address his favorite of all his speeches. at this time a victory over the rebels was at hand slavery was dead and lincoln was looking to the future.. running the machine. an 1864 cartoon featuring lincoln william fessenden edwin stanton william seward and gideon welles takes a swing at the lincoln administration. the war was a source of constant frustration for the president and occupied nearly all of his time. he had a contentious relationship with general mcclellan who became generalinchief of all the union armies in the wake of the embarrassing union defeat at the first battle of bull run and after the retirement of winfield scott in late 1861. despite his inexperience in military affairs lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. his priorities were twofold to ensure that washington d.c. was well defended and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the northern public and press. mcclellan a youthful west point graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service took a more cautious approach. he took several months to plan and execute his peninsula campaign with the objective of capturing richmond by moving the army of the potomac by boat to the peninsula between the james and york rivers. mcclellans delay irritated lincoln as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend washington d.c. lincoln insisted on holding some of mcclellans troops to defend the capital a decision mcclellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the peninsula campaign.. mcclellan a lifelong democrat who was temperamentally conservative was relieved as generalinchief after releasing his harrisons landing letter where he offered unsolicited political advice to lincoln urging caution in the war effort. mcclellans letter incensed radical republicans who successfully pressured lincoln to appoint john pope a republican as head of the new army of virginia. pope complied with lincolns strategic desire to move toward richmond from the north thus protecting the capital from attack. but pope was soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of 1862 forcing the army of the potomac to defend washington for a second time. in response to his failure pope was sent to minnesota to fight the sioux.. an 1864 mathew brady photo depicts president lincoln reading a book with his youngest son tad. panicked by lees invasion of maryland lincoln restored mcclellan to command of all forces around washington in time for the battle of antietam september 1862. the ensuing union victory enabled lincoln to release his emancipation proclamation but he relieved mcclellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed republican ambrose burnside to head the army of the potomac. burnside had promised to follow through on lincolns strategic vision for a strong offensive against lee and richmond. after burnside was stunningly defeated at fredericksburg joseph hooker was given the command despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders. joseph hooker biography hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville may 1863 and relieved of command early in the subsequent gettysburg campaign replaced by george meade.. after the union victory at gettysburg meades failure to pursue lee and months of inactivity for the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln to bring in a western general ulysses s. grant. grant already had a solid string of victories in the western theater including the battles of vicksburg and chattanooga. responding to criticism of grant lincoln was quoted as saying i cannot spare this man. he fights. grant waged his bloody overland campaign in 1864 with a strategy of a war of attrition characterized by high union losses at battles such as the wilderness and cold harbor but by proportionately higher confederate losses. his invasion campaign eventually bottled lee up in the siege of petersburg so that grant could take richmond and bring the war to a close in the spring of 1865.. lincoln authorized grant to target civilians and infrastructure hoping to destroy the souths morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. this allowed generals sherman and sheridan to destroy farms and towns in the shenandoah valley georgia and south carolina. the damage caused by shermans march to the sea through georgia totaled in excess of 100 million by shermans own estimate. see hofstadter richard the united states the history of a republic prenticehall 1967 p. 446.. lincoln had a starcrossed record as a military leader possessing a keen understanding of strategic points such as the mississippi river and the fortress city of vicksburg and the importance of defeating the enemys army rather than simply capturing cities. he had however limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863 when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in ulysses s. grant. only then could he insist on using african american troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.. throughout the war lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. he spent hours at the war department telegraph office reading dispatches from his generals. he visited battle sites frequently and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. during jubal anderson earlys raid on washington d.c. in 1864 lincoln had to be told to duck to avoid being shot while observing the battle.. reconstruction began during the war as lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the southern states and what to do with confederate leaders and the freed slaves. lincoln led the moderates regarding reconstructionist policy and was usually opposed by the radical republicans under thaddeus stevens in the house and charles sumner and benjamin wade in the senate though he cooperated with these men on most other issues. determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the south lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind union lines. his amnesty proclamation of december 8 1863 offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office had not mistreated union prisoners and would sign an oath of allegiance. ref critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. of special importance were tennessee where lincoln appointed andrew johnson as governor and louisiana where lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. the radicals thought this policy too lenient and passed their own plan the wadedavis bill in 1864. when lincoln pocketvetoed the bill the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from louisiana arkansas and tennessee. donald 1995 ch. 20. on april 9 1865 lee surrendered at appomattox court house in virginia and the war was effectively over. the other rebel armies surrendered soon after and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare. lincoln went to richmond to make a public gesture of sitting at jefferson daviss own desk symbolically saying to the nation that the president of the united states held authority over the entire land. he was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirers quote i know i am free for i have seen the face of father abraham and have felt him. when a general asked lincoln how the defeated confederates should be treated lincoln replied let em up easy. donald 1995 576 580 president lincoln enters richmond 1865 eyewitness to history www.eywitnesstohistory.com 2000.. one of the last photographs of lincoln likely taken between february and april 1865. lincolns powerful rhetoric defined the issues of the war for the nation the world and posterity. his extraordinary command of the english language was evidenced in the gettysburg address a speech dedicating the cemetery at gettysburg that he delivered on november 19 1863. the speech defied lincolns own prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here. lincolns second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted. in these speeches lincoln articulated better than anyone else the rationale behind the union cause.. in recent years historians have stressed lincolns use of and redefinition of republican values. as early as the 1850s a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the constitution lincoln shifted emphasis to the declaration of independence as the foundation of american political valueswhat he called the sheet anchor of republicanism. jaffa 2000 p. 399 the declarations emphasis on freedom and equality for all rather than the constitutions tolerance of slavers shifted the debate. as diggins concludes regarding the highly influential cooper union speech lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself. john patrick diggins the lost soul of american politics virtue selfinterest and the foundations of liberalism 1986 p. 307. his position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism rather than its legalisms. foner 1970 p. 215 says lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism. see also mcpherson 1992 pp.6164. nevertheless in 1861 lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms the constitution was a contract and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state. jaffa 2000 p. 263 that duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in reconstruction.. lincolns second inauguration on march 4 1865. in the photo lincolns assassin john wilkes booth can be seen in the crowd at the top and accomplices david herold lewis powell george atzerodt john surratt and edmund spangler in the bottom crowd. in his gettysburg address lincoln redefined the american nation arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776 conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. he declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth. by emphasizing the centrality of the nation he rebuffed the claims of state sovereignty. while some critics say lincoln moved too far and too fast h.l. mencken said it is difficult to imagine anything more untrue. the union soldiers in the battle actually fought against selfdetermination it was the confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves. mencken did not mention the right of selfdetermination rights for blacks. they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked a new founding of the nation. wills 1992 p. 39.. during the civil war lincoln appropriated powers no previous president had wielded he used his war powers to proclaim a blockade suspended the writ of habeas corpus spent money without congressional authorization and imprisoned 18000 suspected confederate sympathizers without trial. nearly all of his actions although vehemently denounced by the copperheads were subsequently upheld by congress and the courts.. lincoln believed in the whig theory of the presidency which left congress to write the laws while he signed them vetoing only those bills that threatened his war powers. thus he signed the homestead act in 1862 making millions of acres of governmentheld land in the west available for purchase at very low cost. the morrill landgrant colleges act also signed in 1862 provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state. the pacific railway acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the united states first transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869. other important legislation involved economic matters including the first income tax and higher tariffs. also included was the creation of the system of national banks by the national banking acts of 1863 1864 and 1865 which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system. congress created and lincoln approved the department of agriculture in 1862 although that institution would not become a cabinetlevel department until 1889.. the legal tender act of 1862 established the united states note the first paper currency in united states history. this was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.. during the war lincolns treasury department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied souththe most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.. in 1862 lincoln sent a senior general john pope to put down the sioux uprising in minnesota. presented with 303 death warrants for convicted santee dakota who had massacred innocent farmers lincoln

dying of his wounds soon after.. an army surgeon doctor charles leale initially assessed lincolns wound as mortal. the president was taken across the street from the theater to the petersen house where he lay in a coma for nine hours before he died. several physicians attended lincoln including u.s. army surgeon general joseph k. barnes of the army medical museum. using a probe barnes located some fragments of lincolns skull and the ball lodged 6 inches 15 cm inside his brain. lincoln never regained consciousness and was officially pronounced dead at 72210 a.m. april 15 1865 at the age of 56. there is some disagreement among historians as to stantons words after lincoln died. all agree that he began now he belongs to the... with some stating he said ages while others believe he said angels. after lincolns body was returned to the white house his body was prepared for his lying in repose in the east room. he was the first president to lie in state.. the army medical museum now named the national museum of health and medicine has retained in its collection several artifacts relating to the assassination. currently on display are the bullet that was fired from the derringer

of his son william 1654 miles 2661 km to illinois . lincolns body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to illinois. while much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the united states copperheads celebrated the death of a man they considered an unconstitutional tyrant. the lincoln tomb in oak ridge cemetery in springfield is 177 feet 54 m tall and by 1874 was surmounted with several bronze statues of lincoln. to prevent repeated attempts to steal lincolns body and hold it for ransom robert todd lincoln had lincoln exhumed and reinterred in concrete several feet thick in 1901.. with over 120 photographs taken of him lincoln was the most photographed man in the united states up to the time he was assassinated.. lincoln was known for appointing political rivals to high positions in his cabinet to keep in line all factions of his party and to let them battle each other and not combine against lincoln. historians agree that except for simon cameron it was a highly effective group.. abraham lincolns official white house portrait. lincoln appointed the following justices to the supreme court of the united states. in march 1860 in a speech in new haven connecticut lincoln said with respect to slavery whenever this question shall be settled it must be settled on some philosophical basis. no policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained. the philosophical basis for lincolns beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that lincoln be examined seriously as a man of ideas. lincoln was a strong supporter of the american whig version of liberal capitalism who more than most politicians of the time was able to express his ideas within the context of nineteenth century religious beliefs. guelzo pg. 1819. there were few people who strongly or directly influenced lincolns moral and intellectual development and perspectives. there was no teacher mentor church leader community leader or peer that lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. lacking a formal education lincolns personal philosophy was shaped by an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning. it was lincolns reading rather than his relationships that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs. guelzo pg. 20. miller pg. 5759 lincolns reading and study of the bible was an integral part of his intellectual roots.. lincoln did even as a boy largely reject organized religion but the calvinistic doctrine of necessity would remain a factor throughout his life. in 1846 lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as that the human mind is impelled to action or held in rest by some power over which the mind itself has no control. donald pg. 15. the quote came from a letter to the public in which lincoln was denying charges by a political opponent that he was a religious scoffer. in april 1864 in justifying his actions in regard to emancipation lincoln wrote i claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me. now at the end of three years struggle the nations condition is not what either party or any man devised or expected. god alone can claim it. donald pg. 514. as lincoln matured and especially during his term as president the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. on a personal level the death of his son willie in february 1862 may have caused lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace. wilson pg. 251254 after willies death in the summer or early fall of 1862 lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why from a divine standpoint the severity of the war was necessary. lincolns religious skepticism was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the lockean enlightenment and classical liberalism especially economic liberalism. guelzo pg. 20 consistent with the common practice of the whig party lincoln would often use the declaration of independence as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies. guelzo pg.194 in a february 22 1861 speech at independence hall in philadelphia lincoln said. he found in the declaration justification for whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the nativist platform of the know nothings. in claiming that all men were created free lincoln and the whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement expanded education territory to grow and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population. guelzo pg.194195. it was the declaration of independence rather than the bible that lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. he saw the declaration as more than a political document. to him as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders it was foremost a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation. miller pg. 297. while lincoln is usually portrayed bearded he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11yearold grace bedell. lincolns death made the president a martyr to many. repeated polls of historians have ranked lincoln as among the greatest presidents in u.s.

minority rights and human freedom in general.. many american organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image with interests ranging from the gay rightssupporting log cabin republicans to the insurance corporation lincoln national corporation. the lincoln automobile is also named after him. the ballistic missile submarine abraham lincoln ssbn602 and the aircraft carrier abraham lincoln cvn72 were named in his honor. also the liberty ship ss nancy hanks was named to honor his mother. during the spanish civil war the american faction of the international

outspoken opponent of the expansion of slavery in the united states in his short autobiography written for the 1860 presidential campaign lincoln would describe his protest in the illinois legislature as one that briefly defined his position on the slavery question and so far as it goes it was then the same that it is now. this was in reference to the antiexpansion sentiments he had then expressed. doris kearns goodwin team of rivals the political genius of abraham lincoln 2005 p. 91. holzer pg. 232. writing of the cooper union speech holzer notes cooper union proved a unique confluence of political culture rhetorical opportunity technological innovation and human genius and it brought abraham lincoln to the center stage of american politics at precisely the right time and place and with precisely the right message that slavery was wrong and ought to be confined to the areas where it already existed and placed on the course of ultimate extinction... . lincoln won the republican party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year. during his term he helped preserve the united states by leading the defeat of the secessionist confederate states of america in the american civil war. he introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery issuing his emancipation proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the thirteenth amendment to the constitution in 1865.. lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort especially the selection of top generals including ulysses s. grant. historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the republican party well bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. lincoln successfully defused a war scare with the united kingdom in 1861. under his leadership the union took control of the border slave states at the start of the war. additionally he managed his own reelection in the 1864 presidential election.. opponents of the war also known as copperheads criticized him for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. conversely the radical republicans an abolitionist faction of the republican party criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. even with these problems lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches his gettysburg address is but one example of this. at the close of the war lincoln held a moderate view of reconstruction seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. his assassination in 1865 was the first presidential assassination in u.s. history and made him a martyr for the ideal of national unity.. scholars now rank lincoln among the top three u.s. presidents with the majority of those surveyed placing him first. he is noted for his lasting influence on u.s. politics including a redefinition of republicanism. as diggins explains lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself. john patrick diggins the lost soul of american politics virtue selfinterest and the foundations of liberalism 1986 p. 307. foner 1970 p. 215 noted that lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism. jaffa 2000 p. 399 stresses lincolns emphasis on the declaration of independence as what lincoln called the sheet anchor of republicanism. see also mcpherson 1992 pp.6164.. abraham lincoln was born on february 12 1809 to thomas lincoln and nancy hanks two uneducated farmers. lincoln was born in a oneroom log cabin on the sinking spring farm in southeast hardin county kentucky now part of larue county. this area was at the time considered the frontier. the name abraham was chosen to commemorate his grandfather who was killed in an american indian raid in 1786. donald 1995 p 21 his elder sister sarah lincoln was born in 1807 a younger brother thomas jr died in infancy. it is sometimes debated whether lincoln had marfan syndrome an autosomal dominant disorder of the connective tissue characterized by long limbs and great physical stature. marfan syndrome introduction aug 1 2006. symbolic log cabin at abraham lincoln birthplace

cash and assumption of a debt. the farm site is now preserved as part of abraham lincoln birthplace national historic site. the family belonged to a baptist church that had seceded from a larger church over the issue of slavery. though lincoln was exposed to his parents antislavery sentiment from a very young age he never joined their church or any other church for that matter. as a youth he had little use for religion. life of abraham lincoln colonel ward h. lamon 1872 portions reprinted in chapter viii abraham lincoln deist and admirer of thomas paine from the book religious beliefs of our presidents by franklin steiner 1936. lincoln was just seven years old when in 1816 the family was forced to make a new start in perry county now in spencer county indiana. he later noted that this move was partly on account of slavery and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in kentucky unlike land in the northwest territory kentucky never had a proper u.s. survey and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property. lincoln was only nine when his mother then thirtyfour years old died of milk sickness. soon afterwards his father remarried to sarah bush johnston. sarah lincoln raised young lincoln like one of her own children. years later she compared lincoln to her own son saying both were good boys but i must say both now being dead that abe was the best boy i ever saw or ever expect to see. lincoln was affectionate toward his stepmother whom he would call mother for the rest of his life but he was distant from his father. donald 1995 pp. 28 152.. in 1830 after more economic and landtitle difficulties in indiana the family settled on public land ref in macon county illinois. some scholars believe that it was his fathers repeated landtitle difficulties and ensuing financial hardships that led young lincoln to study law. the following winter was desolate and especially brutal and the family considered moving back to indiana. the following year when his father relocated the family to a new homestead in coles county illinois twentytwoyearold lincoln struck out on his own canoeing down the sangamon river to the village of new salem in sangamon county. later that year hired by new salem businessman denton offutt and accompanied by friends he took goods from new salem to new orleans via flatboat on the sangamon illinois and mississippi rivers. while in new orleans he may have witnessed a slave auction though as a frequent visitor to kentucky he would have had several earlier opportunities to witness similar sales. donald 1995 ch. 2.. lincolns formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling. largely selfeducated he read every book he could get his hands on once walking. just to borrow one while his favorite book was the life of george washington lincoln mastered the bible shakespeare and english and american history and developed a plain writing style that puzzled audiences more used to grandiose rhetoric. he was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an ax some rails he had allegedly split in his youth were exhibited at the 1860 republican national convention as the party celebrated the poorboymadegood theme. lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals even for food. though he was unusually tall at 4 inches and strong lincoln spent so much time reading that some neighbors suspected he must be doing it to avoid strenuous manual labor.. young abraham lincoln. lincoln began his political career in 1832 at age 23 with an unsuccessful campaign for the illinois general assembly as a member of the whig party. he ran eighth in a field of 13 candidates. the centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the sangamon river. he believed that this would attract steamboat traffic which would allow the sparsely populated poorer areas along the river to flourish.. he was elected captain of an illinois militia company drawn from new salem during the black hawk war and later wrote that he had not had any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction. thomas 1952 3234 basler 1946 p. 551 though he never saw

for several months lincoln ran a small store in new salem selling tea coffee sugar salt blue calico brown muslin straw hats and whiskey. beveridge 1928 11278 later he found work as village postmaster and as a surveyor.. in 1834 he won election to the state legislature and after coming across the commentaries on the laws of england began to teach himself law. admitted to the bar in 1837 he moved to springfield illinois that same year and began to practice law with john t. stuart. with a reputation as a formidable adversary during crossexaminations and in his closing arguments lincoln became one of the most respected and successful lawyers in illinois and grew steadily more prosperous.. he served four successive terms in the illinois house of representatives as a representative from sangamon county and became a leader of the illinois whig party. in 1837 he made his first protest against slavery in the illinois house stating that the institution was founded on both injustice and bad policy. protest in illinois legislature on slavery p.75 march 3 1837 it was also in this same year that lincoln met joshua fry speed who would become his most intimate friend.. lincoln wrote a series of anonymous letters published in 1842 in the sangamon journal mocking state auditor and prominent democrat james shields. shields would later become a u.s. senator but when he learned that it was lincoln who had been writing the barbs he challenged him to a duel. as shields was the challenger lincoln was granted the right to choose the weapon and specified cavalry broad swords of the largest size. much taller and with long arms this gave him an overwhelming advantage over his opponent however the duel was called off at the last minute. beveridge 1928 1349. lincoln had been practicing with the broad sword. two years later lincoln entered law practice with william herndon a fellow whig. in 1854 both men joined the fledgling republican party. following lincolns death herndon began

photograph ever taken of abraham lincoln a daguerreotype taken by shepherd in 1846.. a whig and an admirer of party leader henry clay lincoln was elected to a term in the u.s. house of representatives in 1846. as a freshman house member he was not a particularly powerful or influential figure. he spoke out against the mexicanamerican war which he attributed to president polks desire for military glory that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood. he also challenged the presidents claims regarding the texas boundary and offered spot resolutions demanding to know on what spot on us soil that blood was first spilt. congressional globe 30th session 1848 pp.9395 in january of 1848 he was among the 82 whigs who defeated 81 democrats in a procedural vote on an amendment to send a routine resolution back to committee with instructions to add the words a war unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the president of the united states. the amendment passed but the bill never reemerged from committee and was never finally voted upon. house journal 30th session 1848 pp.183184. lincoln later damaged his political reputation with a speech in which he declared god of heaven has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men women and children and lay waste and pillage the land of the just. two weeks later president polk sent a peace treaty to congress. while no one in washington paid any attention to lincoln the democrats orchestrated angry outbursts from across his district where the war was popular and many had volunteered. in morgan county resolutions were adopted in fervent support of the war and in wrathful denunciation of the treasonable assaults of guerrillas at home party demagogues slanderers of the president defenders of the butchery at the alamo traducers of the heroism at san jacinto. abe lincoln resource page. warned by his law partner william herndon that the damage was mounting and irreparable lincoln decided not to run for reelection. in fact in 1848 he campaigned vigorously for zachary taylor the successful general whose atrocities he had denounced in january. regardless his statements were not easily forgotten and would haunt him during the civil war. these statements were also held against him when he applied for a position in the new taylor administration. instead taylors people offered lincoln various positions in the remote oregon territory primarily the governorship. acceptance of this offer would have ended his career in the rapidly growing state of illinois so lincoln declined the position. returning to springfield lincoln gave up politics for several years and turned his energies to his law practice. during this time he made many trips on horseback between various counties courthouses. beveridge 1928 1 42833 donald 1995 p. 14043.. in the 1920s historical markers were placed at the county lines along the route lincoln traveled in the eight judicial district. this example is on the border of piatt and dewitt counties. by the mid1850s lincolns caseload focused largely on the competing transportation interests of river barges and railroads. in one prominent 1851 case he represented the alton sangamon railroad in a dispute with a shareholder james a. barret. barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to the railroad on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest that the newer route proposed by alton sangamon was superior and less expensive and that accordingly the corporation had a right to sue barret for his delinquent payment. he won this case and the decision by the illinois supreme court was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the united states. donald 1995 ch. 6.. possibly the most notable criminal trial of lincolns career as a lawyer came in 1858 when he defended william duff armstrong who has been charged with murder. the case became famous for lincolns use of judicial noticea rare tactic at that timeto show that an eyewitness had lied on the stand. after the witness testified to having seen the crime by moonlight lincoln produced a farmers almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle that it could not have provided enough illumination to see anything clearly. based almost entirely on this evidence armstrong was acquitted. donald 1995 15051. lincoln was involved in more than 5100 cases in illinois alone during his 23year legal career. though many of these cases involved little more than filing a writ others were more substantial and quite involved. lincoln and his partners appeared before the illinois state supreme court more than 400 times. during one trial lincolns voir dire included a question to prospective jurors as to whether they were acquainted with counsel for the other side. when a few of them turned out to know the other lawyer the judge interrupted saying mr. lincoln you are wasting the time of the court. the fact that a prospective juror knows your opponent does not disqualify him.. no your honor i understand that lincoln answered. im afraid that some of them might not know him which would place me at a disadvantage.. lincoln returned to politics in response to the kansasnebraska act 1854 which expressly repealed the limits on slaverys extent as determined by the missouri compromise 1820. illinois democrat stephen a. douglas the most powerful man in the senate proposed popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse and incorporated it into the kansasnebraska act. douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory rather than have such a decision imposed on them by congress. donald 1995 ch. 7.. in a speech against the act on october 16 1854 delivered in peoria lincoln first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day. drawing on remnants of the old whig free soil liberty and democratic parties he was instrumental in forming the new republican party. in a stirring campaign the republicans carried illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. lincoln was the obvious choice but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an exdemocrat lyman trumbull.. in 185758 douglas broke with president buchanan leading to a fight for control of the democratic party. some eastern republicans even favored the reelection of douglas in 1858 since he had led the opposition to the lecompton constitution which would have admitted kansas as a slave state. accepting the republican nomination for senate in 1858 lincoln delivered his famous speech a house divided against itself cannot stand.mark 325 i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided. it will become all one thing or all the other. a house divided against itself cannot stand june 1858 the speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate and rallied republicans across the north.. the 1858 campaign featured the lincolndouglas debates a nationally famous contest on slavery. lincoln warned that the slave power was threatening the values of republicanism while douglas emphasized the supremacy of democracy as set forth in his freeport doctrine which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not. though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature reelected douglas to the senate. nevertheless lincolns eloquence transformed him into a national political star.. during the debates of 1858 the issue of race was often discussed. during a time period when few believed in racial egalitarianism stephen douglas informed the crowds if you desire negro citizenship if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves then support mr. lincoln and the black republican party who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro. first debate with stephen a. douglas at ottawa illinois august 21 1858 lincoln countered that he was not in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races. fourth debate with stephen a. douglas at charleston illinois september 18 1858 his opposition to slavery was opposition to the slave power though this would change during the course of the civil war. donald 1995 ch. 8.. on may 910 1860 the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur. at this convention lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.. the rail candidate lincolns 1860 candidacy is held up by slavery issue slave on left and party organization new york tribune editor horace greeley on right. photo of lincoln taken february 27 1860 in new york city by mathew brady the day of his famous cooper union speech.. entering the presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog lincoln was eventually chosen as the republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. his expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals william h. seward and salmon p. chase. his western origins also appealed to the newer states other contenders especially those with more governmental experience had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states while lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the west. most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party as the slave power tightened its grasp on the national government. yet despite his southern connections his inlaws owned slaves lincoln misunderstood the depth of the revolution underway in the south and the emergence of southern nationalism. throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession. gabor s. boritt and the war came? abraham lincoln and the question of individual responsibility why the civil war came ed by boritt 1996 pp 330.. throughout the election lincoln did not campaign or give speeches. this was handled by the state and county republican organizations who used the latest techniques to sustain party enthusiasm and thus obtain high turnout. there was little effort to convert nonrepublicans and there was virtually no campaigning in the south except for a few border cities such as st. louis missouri and wheeling virginia indeed the party did not even run a slate in most of the south. in the north there were thousands of republican speakers tons of campaign posters and leaflets and thousands of newspaper editorials. these focused first on the party platform and second on lincolns life story making the most of his boyhood poverty his pioneer background his native genius and his rise from obscurity. his nicknames honest abe and the railsplitter were exploited to the full. the goal was to emphasize the superior power of free labor whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. thomas 1952 p 216 reinhard h. luthin the first lincoln campaign 1944 nevins vol 4. on november 6 1860 lincoln was elected as the 16th president of the united states beating democrat stephen a. douglas john c. breckinridge of the southern democrats and john bell of the new constitutional union party. he was the first republican president winning entirely on the strength of his support in the north he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the south and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other southern states. lincoln gained 1865908 votes 39.9 of the total for 180 electoral votes douglas 1380202 29.5 for 12 electoral votes breckenridge 848019 18.1 for 72 electoral votes and bell 590901 12.5 for 39 electoral votes. there were fusion tickets in some states but even if his opponents had combined in every state lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election.. as lincolns election became more likely secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the union. south carolina took the lead followed by six other cottongrowing states in the deep south. the upper south delaware maryland virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri and arkansas listened to and rejected the secessionist appeal. they decided to stay in the union though they warned lincoln that they would not support an invasion through their territory. the seven confederate states seceded before lincoln took office declaring themselves to be a new nation the confederate states of america. president buchanan and presidentelect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy.. presidentelect lincoln evaded possible assassins in baltimore and on february 23 1861 arrived in disguise in washington d.c. at his inauguration on march 4 1861 the german american turners formed lincolns bodyguard and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present ready to protect the capital from confederate invasion and local insurrection.. photograph showing the march 4 1861 inauguration of abraham lincoln in front of united states capitol.. in his first inaugural address lincoln declared i hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution the union of these states is perpetual. perpetuity is implied if not expressed in the fundamental law of all national governments arguing further that the purpose of the united states constitution was to form a more perfect union than the articles of confederation which were explicitly perpetual thus the constitution too was perpetual. he asked rhetorically that even were the constitution a simple contract would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?. also in his inaugural address in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war lincoln supported the pending corwin amendment to the constitution which had already passed congress. this amendment which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it existed was designed to appeal not to the confederacy but to the critical border states. at the same time lincoln adamantly opposed the crittenden compromise which would have permitted slavery in the territories. despite support for the crittenden compromise among some prominent republicans including william seward lincoln denounced it saying that it would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people tribe and state owning a foot of land between here and tierra del fuego.. by the time lincoln took office the confederacy was an established fact and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the union on any terms. no compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. lincoln might have allowed the southern states to secede and some republicans recommended that. however conservative democratic nationalists such as jeremiah s. black joseph holt and edwin m. stanton had taken control of buchanans cabinet around january 1 1861 and refused to accept secession. lincoln and nearly every republican leader adopted this position by march 1861 the union could not be dismantled. however as a strict follower of the constitution lincoln refused to take any action against the south unless the unionists themselves were attacked first. this finally happened in april 1861.. historian allan nevins argues that lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the union hold government property and still avoid war. he temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis overestimated the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and border states and misunderstood the conditional support of unionists in the border states. allan nevins the improvised war 18611862 1959 p 29. in april 1861 after union troops at fort sumter were fired upon and forced to surrender lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75000 troops to recapture forts protect the capital and preserve the union which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. virginia which had repeatedly warned lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state responded by seceding along with north carolina tennessee and arkansas.. the slave states of missouri kentucky maryland and delaware did not secede and lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there promising not to interfere with slavery. after the fighting started he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas especially in maryland and held in military prisons without trial. over 18000 were arrested though none were executed. one clement vallandigham was exiled but all of the remainder were released usually after two or three months see ex parte merryman.. lincoln met with his cabinet for the first reading of the emancipation proclamation draft on july 22 1862. lr edwin m. stanton salmon p. chase abraham lincoln gideon welles caleb b. smith william h. seward montgomery blair and edward bates. in july 1862 congress moved to free the slaves by passing the second confiscation act. the goal was to weaken the rebellion which was led and controlled by slave owners. while it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery the thirteenth amendment did that the act showed that lincoln had the support of congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. this new law was implemented with lincolns emancipation proclamation.. lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the united states. in 1861 1862 however he made it clear that the north was fighting the war to preserve the union not to abolish slavery. freeing the slaves became in late 1862 a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. abolitionists criticized lincoln for his sluggishness over slavery per se but on august 22 1862 lincoln explained. the emancipation proclamation announced on september 22 and put into effect on january 1 1863 freed slaves in territories not under union control. as union armies advanced south more slaves were liberated until all of them in confederate hands over three million were freed. lincoln later said i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper. the proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the thirteenth amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation. lincoln addressed the issue of his consistency in an 1864 letter to albert g. hodges. letter to albert g. hodges april 4 1864. in september 1862 thirteen northern governors met in altoona pennsylvania at the loyal war governors conference to discuss the proclamation and union war effort. in the end the state executives fully supported the presidents proclamation and also suggested the removal of general george b. mcclellan as commander of the unions army of the potomac. images of america altoona by sr. anne francis pulling 2001 10.. for some time lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. he commented favorably on colonization in the emancipation proclamation but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. as frederick douglass observed lincoln was the first great man that i talked with in the united states freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself of the difference of color. life and times of frederick douglass by frederick douglass 1895. after union victories at gettysburg vicksburg and chattanooga in 1863 victory seemed at hand and lincoln promoted ulysses s. grant generalinchief march 12 1864. when the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates lincoln supported grants strategy of wearing down lees confederate army at the cost of heavy union casualties. with an election looming he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. at the convention the republican party selected andrew johnson a war democrat from the southern state of tennessee as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. they ran on the new union party ticket uniting republicans and war democrats.. lincoln in top hat with allan pinkerton and gen. john alexander mcclernand at antietam.. nevertheless republicans across the country feared that lincoln would be defeated. acknowledging this fear lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that if he should lose the election he would nonetheless defeat the confederacy by an allout military effort before turning over the white house mark grimsley and brooks d simpson eds. the collapse of the confederacy 2001 p 80. lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.. while the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war a failure their candidate general george b. mcclellan supported the war and repudiated the platform.. lincoln provided grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to support grant and win local support for the war effort. shermans capture of atlanta in september ended defeatist jitters the democratic party was deeply split with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln the union party was united and energized and lincoln was easily reelected in a landslide. he won all but two states capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.. on march 4 1865 lincoln delivered his second inaugural address his favorite of all his speeches. at this time a victory over the rebels was at hand slavery was dead and lincoln was looking to the future.. running the machine. an 1864 cartoon featuring lincoln william fessenden edwin stanton william seward and gideon welles takes a swing at the lincoln administration. the war was a source of constant frustration for the president and occupied nearly all of his time. he had a contentious relationship with general mcclellan who became generalinchief of all the union armies in the wake of the embarrassing union defeat at the first battle of bull run and after the retirement of winfield scott in late 1861. despite his inexperience in military affairs lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. his priorities were twofold to ensure that washington d.c. was well defended and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the northern public and press. mcclellan a youthful west point graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service took a more cautious approach. he took several months to plan and execute his peninsula campaign with the objective of capturing richmond by moving the army of the potomac by boat to the peninsula between the james and york rivers. mcclellans delay irritated lincoln as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend washington d.c. lincoln insisted on holding some of mcclellans troops to defend the capital a decision mcclellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the peninsula campaign.. mcclellan a lifelong democrat who was temperamentally conservative was relieved as generalinchief after releasing his harrisons landing letter where he offered unsolicited political advice to lincoln urging caution in the war effort. mcclellans letter incensed radical republicans who successfully pressured lincoln to appoint john pope a republican as head of the new army of virginia. pope complied with lincolns strategic desire to move toward richmond from the north thus protecting the capital from attack. but pope was soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of 1862 forcing the army of the potomac to defend washington for a second time. in response to his failure pope was sent to minnesota to fight the sioux.. an 1864 mathew brady photo depicts president lincoln reading a book with his youngest son tad. panicked by lees invasion of maryland lincoln restored mcclellan to command of all forces around washington in time for the battle of antietam september 1862. the ensuing union victory enabled lincoln to release his emancipation proclamation but he relieved mcclellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed republican ambrose burnside to head the army of the potomac. burnside had promised to follow through on lincolns strategic vision for a strong offensive against lee and richmond. after burnside was stunningly defeated at fredericksburg joseph hooker was given the command despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders. joseph hooker biography hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville may 1863 and relieved of command early in the subsequent gettysburg campaign replaced by george meade.. after the union victory at gettysburg meades failure to pursue lee and months of inactivity for the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln to bring in a western general ulysses s. grant. grant already had a solid string of victories in the western theater including the battles of vicksburg and chattanooga. responding to criticism of grant lincoln was quoted as saying i cannot spare this man. he fights. grant waged his bloody overland campaign in 1864 with a strategy of a war of attrition characterized by high union losses at battles such as the wilderness and cold harbor but by proportionately higher confederate losses. his invasion campaign eventually bottled lee up in the siege of petersburg so that grant could take richmond and bring the war to a close in the spring of 1865.. lincoln authorized grant to target civilians and infrastructure hoping to destroy the souths morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. this allowed generals sherman and sheridan to destroy farms and towns in the shenandoah valley georgia and south carolina. the damage caused by shermans march to the sea through georgia totaled in excess of 100 million by shermans own estimate. see hofstadter richard the united states the history of a republic prenticehall 1967 p. 446.. lincoln had a starcrossed record as a military leader possessing a keen understanding of strategic points such as the mississippi river and the fortress city of vicksburg and the importance of defeating the enemys army rather than simply capturing cities. he had however limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863 when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in ulysses s. grant. only then could he insist on using african american troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.. throughout the war lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. he spent hours at the war department telegraph office reading dispatches from his generals. he visited battle sites frequently and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. during jubal anderson earlys raid on washington d.c. in 1864 lincoln had to be told to duck to avoid being shot while observing the battle.. reconstruction began during the war as lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the southern states and what to do with confederate leaders and the freed slaves. lincoln led the moderates regarding reconstructionist policy and was usually opposed by the radical republicans under thaddeus stevens in the house and charles sumner and benjamin wade in the senate though he cooperated with these men on most other issues. determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the south lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind union lines. his amnesty proclamation of december 8 1863 offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office had not mistreated union prisoners and would sign an oath of allegiance. ref critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. of special importance were tennessee where lincoln appointed andrew johnson as governor and louisiana where lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. the radicals thought this policy too lenient and passed their own plan the wadedavis bill in 1864. when lincoln pocketvetoed the bill the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from louisiana arkansas and tennessee. donald 1995 ch. 20. on april 9 1865 lee surrendered at appomattox court house in virginia and the war was effectively over. the other rebel armies surrendered soon after and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare. lincoln went to richmond to make a public gesture of sitting at jefferson daviss own desk symbolically saying to the nation that the president of the united states held authority over the entire land. he was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirers quote i know i am free for i have seen the face of father abraham and have felt him. when a general asked lincoln how the defeated confederates should be treated lincoln replied let em up easy. donald 1995 576 580 president lincoln enters richmond 1865 eyewitness to history www.eywitnesstohistory.com 2000.. one of the last photographs of lincoln likely taken between february and april 1865. lincolns powerful rhetoric defined the issues of the war for the nation the world and posterity. his extraordinary command of the english language was evidenced in the gettysburg address a speech dedicating the cemetery at gettysburg that he delivered on november 19 1863. the speech defied lincolns own prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here. lincolns second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted. in these speeches lincoln articulated better than anyone else the rationale behind the union cause.. in recent years historians have stressed lincolns use of and redefinition of republican values. as early as the 1850s a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the constitution lincoln shifted emphasis to the declaration of independence as the foundation of american political valueswhat he called the sheet anchor of republicanism. jaffa 2000 p. 399 the declarations emphasis on freedom and equality for all rather than the constitutions tolerance of slavers shifted the debate. as diggins concludes regarding the highly influential cooper union speech lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself. john patrick diggins the lost soul of american politics virtue selfinterest and the foundations of liberalism 1986 p. 307. his position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism rather than its legalisms. foner 1970 p. 215 says lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism. see also mcpherson 1992 pp.6164. nevertheless in 1861 lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms the constitution was a contract and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state. jaffa 2000 p. 263 that duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in reconstruction.. lincolns second inauguration on march 4 1865. in the photo lincolns assassin john wilkes booth can be seen in the crowd at the top and accomplices david herold lewis powell george atzerodt john surratt and edmund spangler in the bottom crowd. in his gettysburg address lincoln redefined the american nation arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776 conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. he declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth. by emphasizing the centrality of the nation he rebuffed the claims of state sovereignty. while some critics say lincoln moved too far and too fast h.l. mencken said it is difficult to imagine anything more untrue. the union soldiers in the battle actually fought against selfdetermination it was the confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves. mencken did not mention the right of selfdetermination rights for blacks. they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked a new founding of the nation. wills 1992 p. 39.. during the civil war lincoln appropriated powers no previous president had wielded he used his war powers to proclaim a blockade suspended the writ of habeas corpus spent money without congressional authorization and imprisoned 18000 suspected confederate sympathizers without trial. nearly all of his actions although vehemently denounced by the copperheads were subsequently upheld by congress and the courts.. lincoln believed in the whig theory of the presidency which left congress to write the laws while he signed them vetoing only those bills that threatened his war powers. thus he signed the homestead act in 1862 making millions of acres of governmentheld land in the west available for purchase at very low cost. the morrill landgrant colleges act also signed in 1862 provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state. the pacific railway acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the united states first transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869. other important legislation involved economic matters including the first income tax and higher tariffs. also included was the creation of the system of national banks by the national banking acts of 1863 1864 and 1865 which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system. congress created and lincoln approved the department of agriculture in 1862 although that institution would not become a cabinetlevel department until 1889.. the legal tender act of 1862 established the united states note the first paper currency in united states history. this was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.. during the war lincolns treasury department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied souththe most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.. in 1862 lincoln sent a senior general john pope to put down the sioux uprising in minnesota. presented with 303 death warrants for convicted santee dakota who had massacred innocent farmers lincoln

dying of his wounds soon after.. an army surgeon doctor charles leale initially assessed lincolns wound as mortal. the president was taken across the street from the theater to the petersen house where he lay in a coma for nine hours before he died. several physicians attended lincoln including u.s. army surgeon general joseph k. barnes of the army medical museum. using a probe barnes located some fragments of lincolns skull and the ball lodged 6 inches 15 cm inside his brain. lincoln never regained consciousness and was officially pronounced dead at 72210 a.m. april 15 1865 at the age of 56. there is some disagreement among historians as to stantons words after lincoln died. all agree that he began now he belongs to the... with some stating he said ages while others believe he said angels. after lincolns body was returned to the white house his body was prepared for his lying in repose in the east room. he was the first president to lie in state.. the army medical museum now named the national museum of health and medicine has retained in its collection several artifacts relating to the assassination. currently on display are the bullet that was fired from the derringer pistol the probe used by barnes pieces of lincolns skull and hair and the surgeons cuff stained with lincolns blood.. lincolns funeral train carried his remains as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son william 1654 miles 2661 km to illinois . lincolns body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to illinois. while much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the united states copperheads celebrated the death of a man they considered an unconstitutional tyrant. the lincoln tomb in oak ridge cemetery in springfield is 177 feet 54 m tall and by 1874 was surmounted with several bronze statues of lincoln. to prevent repeated attempts to steal lincolns body and hold it for ransom robert todd lincoln had lincoln exhumed and reinterred in concrete several feet thick in 1901.. with over 120 photographs taken of him lincoln was the most photographed man in the united states up to the time he was assassinated.. lincoln was known for appointing political rivals to high positions in his cabinet to keep in line all factions of his party and to let them battle each other and not combine against lincoln. historians agree that except for simon cameron it was a highly effective group.. abraham lincolns official white house portrait. lincoln appointed the following justices to the supreme court of the united states. in march 1860 in a speech in new haven connecticut lincoln said with respect to slavery whenever this question shall be settled it must be settled on some philosophical basis. no policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained. the philosophical basis for lincolns beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that lincoln be examined seriously as a man of ideas. lincoln was a strong supporter of the american whig version of liberal capitalism who more than most politicians of the time was able to express his ideas within the context of nineteenth century religious beliefs. guelzo pg. 1819. there were few people who strongly or directly influenced lincolns moral and intellectual development and perspectives. there was no teacher mentor church leader community leader or peer that lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. lacking a formal education lincolns personal philosophy was shaped by an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning. it was lincolns reading rather than his relationships that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs. guelzo pg. 20. miller pg. 5759 lincolns reading and study of the bible was an integral part of his intellectual roots.. lincoln did even as a boy largely reject organized religion but the calvinistic doctrine of necessity would remain a factor throughout his life. in 1846 lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as that the human mind is impelled to action or held in rest by some power over which the mind itself has no control. donald pg. 15. the quote came from a letter to the public in which lincoln was denying charges by a political opponent that he was a religious scoffer. in april 1864 in justifying his actions in regard to emancipation lincoln wrote i claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me. now at the end of three years struggle the nations condition is not what either party or any man devised or expected. god alone can claim it. donald pg. 514. as lincoln matured and especially during his term as president the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. on a personal level the death of his son willie in february 1862 may have caused lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace. wilson pg. 251254 after willies death in the summer or early fall of 1862 lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why from a divine standpoint the severity of the war was necessary. lincolns religious skepticism was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the lockean enlightenment and classical liberalism especially economic liberalism. guelzo pg. 20 consistent with the common practice of the whig party lincoln would often use the declaration of independence as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies. guelzo pg.194 in a february 22 1861 speech at independence hall in philadelphia lincoln said. he found in the declaration justification for whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the nativist platform of the know nothings. in claiming that all men were created free lincoln and the whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement expanded education territory to grow and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population. guelzo pg.194195. it was the declaration of independence rather than the bible that lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. he saw the declaration as more than a political document. to him as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders it was foremost a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation. miller pg. 297. while lincoln is usually portrayed bearded he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11yearold grace bedell. lincolns death made the president a martyr to many. repeated polls of historians have ranked lincoln as among the greatest presidents in u.s. history often appearing in the first position. among contemporary admirers lincoln is usually seen as personifying classical values of honesty and integrity as well as respect for individual and minority rights and human freedom in general.. many american organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image with interests ranging from the gay rightssupporting log cabin republicans to the insurance corporation lincoln national corporation. the lincoln automobile is also named after him. the ballistic missile submarine abraham lincoln ssbn602 and the aircraft carrier abraham lincoln cvn72 were named in his honor. also the liberty ship ss nancy hanks was named to honor his mother. during the spanish civil war the american faction of the international brigades named themselves the abraham lincoln brigade after lincoln.. lincoln has been memorialized in many city names notably the capital of nebraska. lincoln illinois is the only city to be named for abraham lincoln before he became president. lincolns name and image appear in numerous places. these include the lincoln memorial in washington d.c. the u.s. lincoln 5 bill and the lincoln cent

outspoken opponent of the expansion of slavery in the united states in his short autobiography written for the 1860 presidential campaign lincoln would describe his protest in the illinois legislature as one that briefly defined his position on the slavery question and so far as it goes it was then the same that it is now. this was in reference to the antiexpansion sentiments he had then expressed. doris kearns goodwin team of rivals the political genius of abraham lincoln 2005 p. 91. holzer pg. 232. writing of the cooper union speech holzer notes cooper union proved a unique confluence of political culture rhetorical opportunity technological innovation and human genius and it brought abraham lincoln to the center stage of american politics at precisely the right time and place and with precisely the right message that slavery was wrong and ought to be confined to the areas where it already existed and placed on the course of ultimate extinction... . lincoln won the republican party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year. during his term he helped preserve the united states by leading the defeat of the secessionist confederate states of america in the american civil war. he introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery issuing his emancipation proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the thirteenth amendment to the constitution in 1865.. lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort especially the selection of top generals including ulysses s. grant. historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the republican party well bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. lincoln successfully defused a war scare with the united kingdom in 1861. under his leadership the union took control of the border slave states at the start of the war. additionally he managed his own reelection in the 1864 presidential election.. opponents of the war also known as copperheads criticized him for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. conversely the radical republicans an abolitionist faction of the republican party criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. even with these problems lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches his gettysburg address is but one example of this. at the close of the war lincoln held a moderate view of reconstruction seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. his assassination in 1865 was the first presidential assassination in u.s. history and made him a martyr for the ideal of national unity.. scholars now rank lincoln among the top three u.s. presidents with the majority of those surveyed placing him first. he is noted for his lasting influence on u.s. politics including a redefinition of republicanism. as diggins explains lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself. john patrick diggins the lost soul of american politics virtue selfinterest and the foundations of liberalism 1986 p. 307. foner 1970 p. 215 noted that lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism. jaffa 2000 p. 399 stresses lincolns emphasis on the declaration of independence as what lincoln called the sheet anchor of republicanism. see also mcpherson 1992 pp.6164.. abraham lincoln was born on february 12 1809 to thomas lincoln and nancy hanks two uneducated farmers. lincoln was born in a oneroom log cabin on the sinking spring farm in southeast hardin county kentucky now part of larue county. this area was at the time considered the frontier. the name abraham was chosen to commemorate his grandfather who was killed in an american indian raid in 1786. donald 1995 p 21 his elder sister sarah lincoln was born in 1807 a younger brother thomas jr died in infancy. it is sometimes debated whether lincoln had marfan syndrome an autosomal dominant disorder of the connective tissue characterized by long limbs and great physical stature. marfan syndrome introduction aug 1 2006. symbolic log cabin at abraham lincoln birthplace national historic site.. for some time thomas lincoln was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the kentucky back country. he had purchased the sinking spring farm in december of 1808 for 200 cash and assumption of a debt. the farm site is now preserved as part of abraham lincoln birthplace national historic site. the family belonged to a baptist church that had seceded from a larger church over the issue of slavery. though lincoln was exposed to his parents antislavery sentiment from a very young age he never joined their church or any other church for that matter. as a youth he had little use for religion. life of abraham lincoln colonel ward h. lamon 1872 portions reprinted in chapter viii abraham lincoln deist and admirer of thomas paine from the book religious beliefs of our presidents by franklin steiner 1936. lincoln was just seven years old when in 1816 the family was forced to make a new start in perry county now in spencer county indiana. he later noted that this move was partly on account of slavery and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in kentucky unlike land in the northwest territory kentucky never had a proper u.s. survey and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property. lincoln was only nine when his mother then thirtyfour years old died of milk sickness. soon afterwards his father remarried to sarah bush johnston. sarah lincoln raised young lincoln like one of her own children. years later she compared lincoln to her own son saying both were good boys but i must say both now being dead that abe was the best boy i ever saw or ever expect to see. lincoln was affectionate toward his stepmother whom he would call mother for the rest of his life but he was distant from his father. donald 1995 pp. 28 152.. in 1830 after more economic and landtitle difficulties in indiana the family settled on public land ref in macon county illinois. some scholars believe that it was his fathers repeated landtitle difficulties and ensuing financial hardships that led young lincoln to study law. the following winter was desolate and especially brutal and the family considered moving back to indiana. the following year when his father relocated the family to a new homestead in coles county illinois twentytwoyearold lincoln struck out on his own canoeing down the sangamon river to the village of new salem in sangamon county. later that year hired by new salem businessman denton offutt and accompanied by friends he took goods from new salem to new orleans via flatboat on the sangamon illinois and mississippi rivers. while in new orleans he may have witnessed a slave auction though as a frequent visitor to kentucky he would have had several earlier opportunities to witness similar sales. donald 1995 ch. 2.. lincolns formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling. largely selfeducated he read every book he could get his hands on once walking. just to borrow one while his favorite book was the life of george washington lincoln mastered the bible shakespeare and english and american history and developed a plain writing style that puzzled audiences more used to grandiose rhetoric. he was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an ax some rails he had allegedly split in his youth were exhibited at the 1860 republican national convention as the party celebrated the poorboymadegood theme. lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals even for food. though he was unusually tall at 4 inches and strong lincoln spent so much time reading that some neighbors suspected he must be doing it to avoid strenuous manual labor.. young abraham lincoln. lincoln began his political career in 1832 at age 23 with an unsuccessful campaign for the illinois general assembly as a member of the whig party. he ran eighth in a field of 13 candidates. the centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the sangamon river. he believed that this would attract steamboat traffic which would allow the sparsely populated poorer areas along the river to flourish.. he was elected captain of an illinois militia company drawn from new salem during the black hawk war and later wrote that he had not had any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction. thomas 1952 3234 basler 1946 p. 551 though he never saw combat lincoln did assist in burying the dead from the battle of stillmans run the day after major isaiah stillmans troops fled the field of battle. abraham lincoln online retrieved on march 11 2007. for several months lincoln ran a small store in new salem selling tea coffee sugar salt blue calico brown muslin straw hats and whiskey. beveridge 1928 11278 later he found work as village postmaster and as a surveyor.. in 1834 he won election to the state legislature and after coming across the commentaries on the laws of england began to teach himself law. admitted to the bar in 1837 he moved to springfield illinois that same year and began to practice law with john t. stuart. with a reputation as a formidable adversary during crossexaminations and in his closing arguments lincoln became one of the most respected and successful lawyers in illinois and grew steadily more prosperous.. he served four successive terms in the illinois house of representatives as a representative from sangamon county and became a leader of the illinois whig party. in 1837 he made his first protest against slavery in the illinois house stating that the institution was founded on both injustice and bad policy. protest in illinois legislature on slavery p.75 march 3 1837 it was also in this same year that lincoln met joshua fry speed who would become his most intimate friend.. lincoln wrote a series of anonymous letters published in 1842 in the sangamon journal mocking state auditor and prominent democrat james shields. shields would later become a u.s. senator but when he learned that it was lincoln who had been writing the barbs he challenged him to a duel. as shields was the challenger lincoln was granted the right to choose the weapon and specified cavalry broad swords of the largest size. much taller and with long arms this gave him an overwhelming advantage over his opponent however the duel was called off at the last minute. beveridge 1928 1349. lincoln had been practicing with the broad sword. two years later lincoln entered law practice with william herndon a fellow whig. in 1854 both men joined the fledgling republican party. following lincolns death herndon began collecting stories about lincoln and published them in herndons lincoln.. the first photograph ever taken of mary lincoln a daguerreotype by shepherd in 1846.. on november 4 1842 lincoln married mary todd daughter of a prominent slaveowning family from kentucky. the couple had four sons. robert todd lincoln was born in springfield illinois on 1 august 1843. their only child to survive into adulthood young robert attended phillips exeter academy and harvard college. robert died on july 26 1926 in manchester vermont.. the other lincoln children were born in springfield illinois and died either during childhood or their teen years. edward baker lincoln was born on march 10 1846 and died on 1 february 1850 also in springfield. william wallace lincoln was born on december 21 1850 and died on february 20 1862 in washington d.c. during pres. lincolns first term. thomas tad lincoln was born on 4 april 1853 and died on july 16 1871 in chicago.. four of his wifes brothers fought for the confederacy with one wounded and another killed in action. lieutenant david h. todd a halfbrother of mary todd lincoln served as commandant of the libby prison camp during the war.. the first photograph ever taken of abraham lincoln a daguerreotype taken by shepherd in 1846.. a whig and an admirer of party leader henry clay lincoln was elected to a term in the u.s. house of representatives in 1846. as a freshman house member he was not a particularly powerful or influential figure. he spoke out against the mexicanamerican war which he attributed to president polks desire for military glory that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood. he also challenged the presidents claims regarding the texas boundary and offered spot resolutions demanding to know on what spot on us soil that blood was first spilt. congressional globe 30th session 1848 pp.9395 in january of 1848 he was among the 82 whigs who defeated 81 democrats in a procedural vote on an amendment to send a routine resolution back to committee with instructions to add the words a war unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the president of the united states. the amendment passed but the bill never reemerged from committee and was never finally voted upon. house journal 30th session 1848 pp.183184. lincoln later damaged his political reputation with a speech in which he declared god of heaven has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men women and children and lay waste and pillage the land of the just. two weeks later president polk sent a peace treaty to congress. while no one in washington paid any attention to lincoln the democrats orchestrated angry outbursts from across his district where the war was popular and many had volunteered. in morgan county resolutions were adopted in fervent support of the war and in wrathful denunciation of the treasonable assaults of guerrillas at home party demagogues slanderers of the president defenders of the butchery at the alamo traducers of the heroism at san jacinto. abe lincoln resource page. warned by his law partner william herndon that the damage was mounting and irreparable lincoln decided not to run for reelection. in fact in 1848 he campaigned vigorously for zachary taylor the successful general whose atrocities he had denounced in january. regardless his statements were not easily forgotten and would haunt him during the civil war. these statements were also held against him when he applied for a position in the new taylor administration. instead taylors people offered lincoln various positions in the remote oregon territory primarily the governorship. acceptance of this offer would have ended his career in the rapidly growing state of illinois so lincoln declined the position. returning to springfield lincoln gave up politics for several years and turned his energies to his law practice. during this time he made many trips on horseback between various counties courthouses. beveridge 1928 1 42833 donald 1995 p. 14043.. in the 1920s historical markers were placed at the county lines along the route lincoln traveled in the eight judicial district. this example is on the border of piatt and dewitt counties. by the mid1850s lincolns caseload focused largely on the competing transportation interests of river barges and railroads. in one prominent 1851 case he represented the alton sangamon railroad in a dispute with a shareholder james a. barret. barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to the railroad on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest that the newer route proposed by alton sangamon was superior and less expensive and that accordingly the corporation had a right to sue barret for his delinquent payment. he won this case and the decision by the illinois supreme court was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the united states. donald 1995 ch. 6.. possibly the most notable criminal trial of lincolns career as a lawyer came in 1858 when he defended william duff armstrong who has been charged with murder. the case became famous for lincolns use of judicial noticea rare tactic at that timeto show that an eyewitness had lied on the stand. after the witness testified to having seen the crime by moonlight lincoln produced a farmers almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle that it could not have provided enough illumination to see anything clearly. based almost entirely on this evidence armstrong was acquitted. donald 1995 15051. lincoln was involved in more than 5100 cases in illinois alone during his 23year legal career. though many of these cases involved little more than filing a writ others were more substantial and quite involved. lincoln and his partners appeared before the illinois state supreme court more than 400 times. during one trial lincolns voir dire included a question to prospective jurors as to whether they were acquainted with counsel for the other side. when a few of them turned out to know the other lawyer the judge interrupted saying mr. lincoln you are wasting the time of the court. the fact that a prospective juror knows your opponent does not disqualify him.. no your honor i understand that lincoln answered. im afraid that some of them might not know him which would place me at a disadvantage.. lincoln returned to politics in response to the kansasnebraska act 1854 which expressly repealed the limits on slaverys extent as determined by the missouri compromise 1820. illinois democrat stephen a. douglas the most powerful man in the senate proposed popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse and incorporated it into the kansasnebraska act. douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory rather than have such a decision imposed on them by congress. donald 1995 ch. 7.. in a speech against the act on october 16 1854 delivered in peoria lincoln first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day. drawing on remnants of the old whig free soil liberty and democratic parties he was instrumental in forming the new republican party. in a stirring campaign the republicans carried illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. lincoln was the obvious choice but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an exdemocrat lyman trumbull.. in 185758 douglas broke with president buchanan leading to a fight for control of the democratic party. some eastern republicans even favored the reelection of douglas in 1858 since he had led the opposition to the lecompton constitution which would have admitted kansas as a slave state. accepting the republican nomination for senate in 1858 lincoln delivered his famous speech a house divided against itself cannot stand.mark 325 i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided. it will become all one thing or all the other. a house divided against itself cannot stand june 1858 the speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate and rallied republicans across the north.. the 1858 campaign featured the lincolndouglas debates a nationally famous contest on slavery. lincoln warned that the slave power was threatening the values of republicanism while douglas emphasized the supremacy of democracy as set forth in his freeport doctrine which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not. though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature reelected douglas to the senate. nevertheless lincolns eloquence transformed him into a national political star.. during the debates of 1858 the issue of race was often discussed. during a time period when few believed in racial egalitarianism stephen douglas informed the crowds if you desire negro citizenship if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves then support mr. lincoln and the black republican party who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro. first debate with stephen a. douglas at ottawa illinois august 21 1858 lincoln countered that he was not in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races. fourth debate with stephen a. douglas at charleston illinois september 18 1858 his opposition to slavery was opposition to the slave power though this would change during the course of the civil war. donald 1995 ch. 8.. on may 910 1860 the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur. at this convention lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.. the rail candidate lincolns 1860 candidacy is held up by slavery issue slave on left and party organization new york tribune editor horace greeley on right. photo of lincoln taken february 27 1860 in new york city by mathew brady the day of his famous cooper union speech.. entering the presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog lincoln was eventually chosen as the republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. his expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals william h. seward and salmon p. chase. his western origins also appealed to the newer states other contenders especially those with more governmental experience had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states while lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the west. most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party as the slave power tightened its grasp on the national government. yet despite his southern connections his inlaws owned slaves lincoln misunderstood the depth of the revolution underway in the south and the emergence of southern nationalism. throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession. gabor s. boritt and the war came? abraham lincoln and the question of individual responsibility why the civil war came ed by boritt 1996 pp 330.. throughout the election lincoln did not campaign or give speeches. this was handled by the state and county republican organizations who used the latest techniques to sustain party enthusiasm and thus obtain high turnout. there was little effort to convert nonrepublicans and there was virtually no campaigning in the south except for a few border cities such as st. louis missouri and wheeling virginia indeed the party did not even run a slate in most of the south. in the north there were thousands of republican speakers tons of campaign posters and leaflets and thousands of newspaper editorials. these focused first on the party platform and second on lincolns life story making the most of his boyhood poverty his pioneer background his native genius and his rise from obscurity. his nicknames honest abe and the railsplitter were exploited to the full. the goal was to emphasize the superior power of free labor whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. thomas 1952 p 216 reinhard h. luthin the first lincoln campaign 1944 nevins vol 4. on november 6 1860 lincoln was elected as the 16th president of the united states beating democrat stephen a. douglas john c. breckinridge of the southern democrats and john bell of the new constitutional union party. he was the first republican president winning entirely on the strength of his support in the north he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the south and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other southern states. lincoln gained 1865908 votes 39.9 of the total for 180 electoral votes douglas 1380202 29.5 for 12 electoral votes breckenridge 848019 18.1 for 72 electoral votes and bell 590901 12.5 for 39 electoral votes. there were fusion tickets in some states but even if his opponents had combined in every state lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election.. as lincolns election became more likely secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the union. south carolina took the lead followed by six other cottongrowing states in the deep south. the upper south delaware maryland virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri and arkansas listened to and rejected the secessionist appeal. they decided to stay in the union though they warned lincoln that they would not support an invasion through their territory. the seven confederate states seceded before lincoln took office declaring themselves to be a new nation the confederate states of america. president buchanan and presidentelect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy.. presidentelect lincoln evaded possible assassins in baltimore and on february 23 1861 arrived in disguise in washington d.c. at his inauguration on march 4 1861 the german american turners formed lincolns bodyguard and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present ready to protect the capital from confederate invasion and local insurrection.. photograph showing the march 4 1861 inauguration of abraham lincoln in front of united states capitol.. in his first inaugural address lincoln declared i hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution the union of these states is perpetual. perpetuity is implied if not expressed in the fundamental law of all national governments arguing further that the purpose of the united states constitution was to form a more perfect union than the articles of confederation which were explicitly perpetual thus the constitution too was perpetual. he asked rhetorically that even were the constitution a simple contract would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?. also in his inaugural address in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war lincoln supported the pending corwin amendment to the constitution which had already passed congress. this amendment which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it existed was designed to appeal not to the confederacy but to the critical border states. at the same time lincoln adamantly opposed the crittenden compromise which would have permitted slavery in the territories. despite support for the crittenden compromise among some prominent republicans including william seward lincoln denounced it saying that it would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people tribe and state owning a foot of land between here and tierra del fuego.. by the time lincoln took office the confederacy was an established fact and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the union on any terms. no compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. lincoln might have allowed the southern states to secede and some republicans recommended that. however conservative democratic nationalists such as jeremiah s. black joseph holt and edwin m. stanton had taken control of buchanans cabinet around january 1 1861 and refused to accept secession. lincoln and nearly every republican leader adopted this position by march 1861 the union could not be dismantled. however as a strict follower of the constitution lincoln refused to take any action against the south unless the unionists themselves were attacked first. this finally happened in april 1861.. historian allan nevins argues that lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the union hold government property and still avoid war. he temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis overestimated the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and border states and misunderstood the conditional support of unionists in the border states. allan nevins the improvised war 18611862 1959 p 29. in april 1861 after union troops at fort sumter were fired upon and forced to surrender lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75000 troops to recapture forts protect the capital and preserve the union which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. virginia which had repeatedly warned lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state responded by seceding along with north carolina tennessee and arkansas.. the slave states of missouri kentucky maryland and delaware did not secede and lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there promising not to interfere with slavery. after the fighting started he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas especially in maryland and held in military prisons without trial. over 18000 were arrested though none were executed. one clement vallandigham was exiled but all of the remainder were released usually after two or three months see ex parte merryman.. lincoln met with his cabinet for the first reading of the emancipation proclamation draft on july 22 1862. lr edwin m. stanton salmon p. chase abraham lincoln gideon welles caleb b. smith william h. seward montgomery blair and edward bates. in july 1862 congress moved to free the slaves by passing the second confiscation act. the goal was to weaken the rebellion which was led and controlled by slave owners. while it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery the thirteenth amendment did that the act showed that lincoln had the support of congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. this new law was implemented with lincolns emancipation proclamation.. lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the united states. in 1861 1862 however he made it clear that the north was fighting the war to preserve the union not to abolish slavery. freeing the slaves became in late 1862 a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. abolitionists criticized lincoln for his sluggishness over slavery per se but on august 22 1862 lincoln explained. the emancipation proclamation announced on september 22 and put into effect on january 1 1863 freed slaves in territories not under union control. as union armies advanced south more slaves were liberated until all of them in confederate hands over three million were freed. lincoln later said i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper. the proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the thirteenth amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation. lincoln addressed the issue of his consistency in an 1864 letter to albert g. hodges. letter to albert g. hodges april 4 1864. in september 1862 thirteen northern governors met in altoona pennsylvania at the loyal war governors conference to discuss the proclamation and union war effort. in the end the state executives fully supported the presidents proclamation and also suggested the removal of general george b. mcclellan as commander of the unions army of the potomac. images of america altoona by sr. anne francis pulling 2001 10.. for some time lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. he commented favorably on colonization in the emancipation proclamation but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. as frederick douglass observed lincoln was the first great man that i talked with in the united states freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself of the difference of color. life and times of frederick douglass by frederick douglass 1895. after union victories at gettysburg vicksburg and chattanooga in 1863 victory seemed at hand and lincoln promoted ulysses s. grant generalinchief march 12 1864. when the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates lincoln supported grants strategy of wearing down lees confederate army at the cost of heavy union casualties. with an election looming he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. at the convention the republican party selected andrew johnson a war democrat from the southern state of tennessee as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. they ran on the new union party ticket uniting republicans and war democrats.. lincoln in top hat with allan pinkerton and gen. john alexander mcclernand at antietam.. nevertheless republicans across the country feared that lincoln would be defeated. acknowledging this fear lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that if he should lose the election he would nonetheless defeat the confederacy by an allout military effort before turning over the white house mark grimsley and brooks d simpson eds. the collapse of the confederacy 2001 p 80. lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.. while the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war a failure their candidate general george b. mcclellan supported the war and repudiated the platform.. lincoln provided grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to support grant and win local support for the war effort. shermans capture of atlanta in september ended defeatist jitters the democratic party was deeply split with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln the union party was united and energized and lincoln was easily reelected in a landslide. he won all but two states capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.. on march 4 1865 lincoln delivered his second inaugural address his favorite of all his speeches. at this time a victory over the rebels was at hand slavery was dead and lincoln was looking to the future.. running the machine. an 1864 cartoon featuring lincoln william fessenden edwin stanton william seward and gideon welles takes a swing at the lincoln administration. the war was a source of constant frustration for the president and occupied nearly all of his time. he had a contentious relationship with general mcclellan who became generalinchief of all the union armies in the wake of the embarrassing union defeat at the first battle of bull run and after the retirement of winfield scott in late 1861. despite his inexperience in military affairs lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. his priorities were twofold to ensure that washington d.c. was well defended and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the northern public and press. mcclellan a youthful west point graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service took a more cautious approach. he took several months to plan and execute his peninsula campaign with the objective of capturing richmond by moving the army of the potomac by boat to the peninsula between the james and york rivers. mcclellans delay irritated lincoln as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend washington d.c. lincoln insisted on holding some of mcclellans troops to defend the capital a decision mcclellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the peninsula campaign.. mcclellan a lifelong democrat who was temperamentally conservative was relieved as generalinchief after releasing his harrisons landing letter where he offered unsolicited political advice to lincoln urging caution in the war effort. mcclellans letter incensed radical republicans who successfully pressured lincoln to appoint john pope a republican as head of the new army of virginia. pope complied with lincolns strategic desire to move toward richmond from the north thus protecting the capital from attack. but pope was soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of 1862 forcing the army of the potomac to defend washington for a second time. in response to his failure pope was sent to minnesota to fight the sioux.. an 1864 mathew brady photo depicts president lincoln reading a book with his youngest son tad. panicked by lees invasion of maryland lincoln restored mcclellan to command of all forces around washington in time for the battle of antietam september 1862. the ensuing union victory enabled lincoln to release his emancipation proclamation but he relieved mcclellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed republican ambrose burnside to head the army of the potomac. burnside had promised to follow through on lincolns strategic vision for a strong offensive against lee and richmond. after burnside was stunningly defeated at fredericksburg joseph hooker was given the command despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders. joseph hooker biography hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville may 1863 and relieved of command early in the subsequent gettysburg campaign replaced by george meade.. after the union victory at gettysburg meades failure to pursue lee and months of inactivity for the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln to bring in a western general ulysses s. grant. grant already had a solid string of victories in the western theater including the battles of vicksburg and chattanooga. responding to criticism of grant lincoln was quoted as saying i cannot spare this man. he fights. grant waged his bloody overland campaign in 1864 with a strategy of a war of attrition characterized by high union losses at battles such as the wilderness and cold harbor but by proportionately higher confederate losses. his invasion campaign eventually bottled lee up in the siege of petersburg so that grant could take richmond and bring the war to a close in the spring of 1865.. lincoln authorized grant to target civilians and infrastructure hoping to destroy the souths morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. this allowed generals sherman and sheridan to destroy farms and towns in the shenandoah valley georgia and south carolina. the damage caused by shermans march to the sea through georgia totaled in excess of 100 million by shermans own estimate. see hofstadter richard the united states the history of a republic prenticehall 1967 p. 446.. lincoln had a starcrossed record as a military leader possessing a keen understanding of strategic points such as the mississippi river and the fortress city of vicksburg and the importance of defeating the enemys army rather than simply capturing cities. he had however limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863 when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in ulysses s. grant. only then could he insist on using african american troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.. throughout the war lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. he spent hours at the war department telegraph office reading dispatches from his generals. he visited battle sites frequently and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. during jubal anderson earlys raid on washington d.c. in 1864 lincoln had to be told to duck to avoid being shot while observing the battle.. reconstruction began during the war as lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the southern states and what to do with confederate leaders and the freed slaves. lincoln led the moderates regarding reconstructionist policy and was usually opposed by the radical republicans under thaddeus stevens in the house and charles sumner and benjamin wade in the senate though he cooperated with these men on most other issues. determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the south lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind union lines. his amnesty proclamation of december 8 1863 offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office had not mistreated union prisoners and would sign an oath of allegiance. ref critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. of special importance were tennessee where lincoln appointed andrew johnson as governor and louisiana where lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. the radicals thought this policy too lenient and passed their own plan the wadedavis bill in 1864. when lincoln pocketvetoed the bill the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from louisiana arkansas and tennessee. donald 1995 ch. 20. on april 9 1865 lee surrendered at appomattox court house in virginia and the war was effectively over. the other rebel armies surrendered soon after and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare. lincoln went to richmond to make a public gesture of sitting at jefferson daviss own desk symbolically saying to the nation that the president of the united states held authority over the entire land. he was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirers quote i know i am free for i have seen the face of father abraham and have felt him. when a general asked lincoln how the defeated confederates should be treated lincoln replied let em up easy. donald 1995 576 580 president lincoln enters richmond 1865 eyewitness to history www.eywitnesstohistory.com 2000.. one of the last photographs of lincoln likely taken between february and april 1865. lincolns powerful rhetoric defined the issues of the war for the nation the world and posterity. his extraordinary command of the english language was evidenced in the gettysburg address a speech dedicating the cemetery at gettysburg that he delivered on november 19 1863. the speech defied lincolns own prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here. lincolns second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted. in these speeches lincoln articulated better than anyone else the rationale behind the union cause.. in recent years historians have stressed lincolns use of and redefinition of republican values. as early as the 1850s a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the constitution lincoln shifted emphasis to the declaration of independence as the foundation of american political valueswhat he called the sheet anchor of republicanism. jaffa 2000 p. 399 the declarations emphasis on freedom and equality for all rather than the constitutions tolerance of slavers shifted the debate. as diggins concludes regarding the highly influential cooper union speech lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself. john patrick diggins the lost soul of american politics virtue selfinterest and the foundations of liberalism 1986 p. 307. his position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism rather than its legalisms. foner 1970 p. 215 says lincoln stressed the moral basis of republicanism. see also mcpherson 1992 pp.6164. nevertheless in 1861 lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms the constitution was a contract and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state. jaffa 2000 p. 263 that duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in reconstruction.. lincolns second inauguration on march 4 1865. in the photo lincolns assassin john wilkes booth can be seen in the crowd at the top and accomplices david herold lewis powell george atzerodt john surratt and edmund spangler in the bottom crowd. in his gettysburg address lincoln redefined the american nation arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776 conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. he declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth. by emphasizing the centrality of the nation he rebuffed the claims of state sovereignty. while some critics say lincoln moved too far and too fast h.l. mencken said it is difficult to imagine anything more untrue. the union soldiers in the battle actually fought against selfdetermination it was the confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves. mencken did not mention the right of selfdetermination rights for blacks. they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked a new founding of the nation. wills 1992 p. 39.. during the civil war lincoln appropriated powers no previous president had wielded he used his war powers to proclaim a blockade suspended the writ of habeas corpus spent money without congressional authorization and imprisoned 18000 suspected confederate sympathizers without trial. nearly all of his actions although vehemently denounced by the copperheads were subsequently upheld by congress and the courts.. lincoln believed in the whig theory of the presidency which left congress to write the laws while he signed them vetoing only those bills that threatened his war powers. thus he signed the homestead act in 1862 making millions of acres of governmentheld land in the west available for purchase at very low cost. the morrill landgrant colleges act also signed in 1862 provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state. the pacific railway acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the united states first transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869. other important legislation involved economic matters including the first income tax and higher tariffs. also included was the creation of the system of national banks by the national banking acts of 1863 1864 and 1865 which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system. congress created and lincoln approved the department of agriculture in 1862 although that institution would not become a cabinetlevel department until 1889.. the legal tender act of 1862 established the united states note the first paper currency in united states history. this was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.. during the war lincolns treasury department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied souththe most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.. in 1862 lincoln sent a senior general john pope to put down the sioux uprising in minnesota. presented with 303 death warrants for convicted santee dakota who had massacred innocent farmers lincoln affirmed 39 of these for execution one was later reprieved.. the assassination of abraham lincoln. from left to right henry rathbone clara harris mary todd lincoln abraham lincoln and john wilkes booth. originally john wilkes booth a wellknown actor and a confederate spy from maryland had formulated a plan to kidnap lincoln in exchange for the release of confederate prisoners. after attending an april 11 speech in which lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks an incensed booth changed his plans and determined to assassinate the president. harrison lowell hayes lincoln of kentucky university press of kentucky 2000 pp. 34. isbn 0813121566. learning that the president and first lady together with the grants would be attending fords theatre he laid his plans assigning his coconspirators to assassinate vice president andrew johnson and secretary of state william h. seward.. without his main bodyguard ward hill lamon to whom he related his famous dream regarding his own assassination lincoln left to attend the play our american cousin on april 14 1865. as a lone bodyguard wandered and lincoln sat in his state box box 7 in the balcony booth crept up behind the president and waited for the funniest line of the play hoping the laughter would muffle the noise of the gunshot. when the laughter began booth jumped into the box and aimed a singleshot roundslug .44 caliber henry deringer at his head firing at pointblank range. major henry rathbone momentarily grappled with booth but was cut by booths knife. booth then leapt to the stage and shouted sic semper tyrannis latin thus always to tyrants and escaped despite a broken leg suffered in the leap. george alfred townsend the life crime and capture of john wilkes booth. new york dick fitzgerald 1865. lccn 12002580. a twelveday manhunt ensued in which booth was chased by federal agents under the direction of secretary of war edwin m. stanton. he was eventually cornered in a virginia barn house and shot dying of his wounds soon after.. an army surgeon doctor charles leale initially assessed lincolns wound as mortal. the president was taken across the street from the theater to the petersen house where he lay in a coma for nine hours before he died. several physicians attended lincoln including u.s. army surgeon general joseph k. barnes of the army medical museum. using a probe barnes located some fragments of lincolns skull and the ball lodged 6 inches 15 cm inside his brain. lincoln never regained consciousness and was officially pronounced dead at 72210 a.m. april 15 1865 at the age of 56. there is some disagreement among historians as to stantons words after lincoln died. all agree that he began now he belongs to the... with some stating he said ages while others believe he said angels. after lincolns body was returned to the white house his body was prepared for his lying in repose in the east room. he was the first president to lie in state.. the army medical museum now named the national museum of health and medicine has retained in its collection several artifacts relating to the assassination. currently on display are the bullet that was fired from the derringer pistol the probe used by barnes pieces of lincolns skull and hair and the surgeons cuff stained with lincolns blood.. lincolns funeral train carried his remains as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son william 1654 miles 2661 km to illinois . lincolns body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to illinois. while much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the united states copperheads celebrated the death of a man they considered an unconstitutional tyrant. the lincoln tomb in oak ridge cemetery in springfield is 177 feet 54 m tall and by 1874 was surmounted with several bronze statues of lincoln. to prevent repeated attempts to steal lincolns body and hold it for ransom robert todd lincoln had lincoln exhumed and reinterred in concrete several feet thick in 1901.. with over 120 photographs taken of him lincoln was the most photographed man in the united states up to the time he was assassinated.. lincoln was known for appointing political rivals to high positions in his cabinet to keep in line all factions of his party and to let them battle each other and not combine against lincoln. historians agree that except for simon cameron it was a highly effective group.. abraham lincolns official white house portrait. lincoln appointed the following justices to the supreme court of the united states. in march 1860 in a speech in new haven connecticut lincoln said with respect to slavery whenever this question shall be settled it must be settled on some philosophical basis. no policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained. the philosophical basis for lincolns beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that lincoln be examined seriously as a man of ideas. lincoln was a strong supporter of the american whig version of liberal capitalism who more than most politicians of the time was able to express his ideas within the context of nineteenth century religious beliefs. guelzo pg. 1819. there were few people who strongly or directly influenced lincolns moral and intellectual development and perspectives. there was no teacher mentor church leader community leader or peer that lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. lacking a formal education lincolns personal philosophy was shaped by an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning. it was lincolns reading rather than his relationships that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs. guelzo pg. 20. miller pg. 5759 lincolns reading and study of the bible was an integral part of his intellectual roots.. lincoln did even as a boy largely reject organized religion but the calvinistic doctrine of necessity would remain a factor throughout his life. in 1846 lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as that the human mind is impelled to action or held in rest by some power over which the mind itself has no control. donald pg. 15. the quote came from a letter to the public in which lincoln was denying charges by a political opponent that he was a religious scoffer. in april 1864 in justifying his actions in regard to emancipation lincoln wrote i claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me. now at the end of three years struggle the nations condition is not what either party or any man devised or expected. god alone can claim it. donald pg. 514. as lincoln matured and especially during his term as president the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. on a personal level the death of his son willie in february 1862 may have caused lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace. wilson pg. 251254 after willies death in the summer or early fall of 1862 lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why from a divine standpoint the severity of the war was necessary. lincolns religious skepticism was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the lockean enlightenment and classical liberalism especially economic liberalism. guelzo pg. 20 consistent with the common practice of the whig party lincoln would often use the declaration of independence as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies. guelzo pg.194 in a february 22 1861 speech at independence hall in philadelphia lincoln said. he found in the declaration justification for whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the nativist platform of the know nothings. in claiming that all men were created free lincoln and the whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement expanded education territory to grow and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population. guelzo pg.194195. it was the declaration of independence rather than the bible that lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. he saw the declaration as more than a political document. to him as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders it was foremost a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation. miller pg. 297. while lincoln is usually portrayed bearded he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11yearold grace bedell. lincolns death made the president a martyr to many. repeated polls of historians have ranked lincoln as among the greatest presidents in u.s. history often appearing in the first position. among contemporary admirers lincoln is usually seen as personifying classical values of honesty and integrity as well as respect for individual and minority rights and human freedom in general.. many american organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image with interests ranging from the gay rightssupporting log cabin republicans to the insurance corporation lincoln national corporation. the lincoln automobile is also named after him. the ballistic missile submarine abraham lincoln ssbn602 and the aircraft carrier abraham lincoln cvn72 were named in his honor. also the liberty ship ss nancy hanks was named to honor his mother. during the spanish civil war the american faction of the international brigades named themselves the abraham lincoln brigade after lincoln.. lincoln has been memorialized in many city names notably the capital of nebraska. lincoln illinois is the only city to be named for abraham lincoln before he became president. lincolns name and image appear in numerous places. these include the lincoln memorial in washington d.c. the u.s. lincoln 5 bill and the lincoln cent lincolns sculpture on the mount rushmore and the lincoln home national historic site in springfield illinois. in addition new salem illinois a reconstruction of lincolns early adult hometown fords theatre and petersen house where he died are all preserved as museums. the lincoln shrine in redlands california is located behind the a.k. smiley public library. the state nickname for illinois is land of lincoln.. counties in 19 u.s. states arkansas colorado idaho kansas maine minnesota mississippi montana nebraska nevada new mexico oklahoma oregon south dakota tennessee west virginia washington wisconsin and wyoming are named after lincoln.. abraham lincolns birthday february 12 was formerly a national holiday now commemorated as presidents day. however it is still observed in illinois and many other states as a separate legal holiday lincolns birthday. a dozen states have legal holidays celebrating the third monday in february as presidents day as a combination washingtonlincoln day.. to commemorate his upcoming 200th birthday in february 2009 congress established the abraham lincoln bicentennial commission albc in 2000. dedicated to renewing american appreciation of lincolns legacy the 15member commission is made up of lawmakers and scholars and also features an adivsory board of over 130 various lincoln historians and enthusiasts. located at library of congress in washington d.c. the albc is the organizing force behind numerous tributes programs and cultural events highlighting a twoyear celebration scheduled to begin in february 2008 at

individual. they are generally social animals and can be seen in small harems to large herds. in addition to their stripes zebras have erect mohawklike manes. unlike their closest relatives horses and asses zebras have never been truly domesticated.. there are three species of zebra the plains zebra grévys zebra and the mountain zebra. the plains zebra and the mountain zebra belong to the subgenus hippotigris but grevys zebra is the sole species of subgenus dolichohippus. the latter resembles an ass while the former two are more horselike. nevertheless dna and molecular data show that zebras do indeed have monophyletic origins. all three belong to the genus equus along with other living equids. in certain regions of kenya plains zebras and grevys zebras coexist.. the unique stripes and behaviors of zebras make these among the animals most familiar to people. they can be found in a variety of habitats such as grasslands savannas woodlands thorny scrublands mountains and coastal hills. however various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations in particular hunting for skins and habitat destruction. grevys zebra and the mountain zebra are endangered. while plains zebras are much more plentiful one subspecies the quagga went extinct in the late nineteenth century.. the name zebra comes from the old portuguese word zevra which means wild ass. the pronunciation is internationally or in north america.. zebras were the second lineage to diverge from the earliest protohorses after the asses around 4 million years ago. grevys zebra is believed to have been the first zebra species to emerge. the ancestors of the equus horses are believed to have been striped and zebras must have retained the stripes of their ancestors due to their advantage for social animals in tropical environments. extensive stripes would be of little use to equids that live in low densities in deserts like asses and some horses or ones that live in colder climates with shaggy coats and annual shading like some horses. fossils of an ancient equid were discovered in the hagerman fossil beds national monument in hagerman idaho. it was named the hagerman horse with a scientific name of equus simplicidens. it is believed to have been similar to the grevys zebra. the animals had stocky zebralike bodies and short narrow donkeylike skulls. grevys zebra also has a donkeylike skull. the hagerman horse is also called the american zebra or hagerman zebra.. zebras in botswana. there are three extant species. collectively two of the species have 8 subspecies 7 extant. zebra populations are diverse and the relationships between and the taxonomic status of several of the subspecies are not well known.. genus equus. subgenus hippotigris. plains zebra equus quagga. quagga equus quagga quagga extinct. burchells zebra equus quagga burchellii includes damara zebra. grants zebra equus quagga boehmi. selous zebra equus quagga borensis. chapmans zebra equus quagga chapmani. crawshays zebra equus quagga crawshayi. mountain zebra equus zebra. cape mountain zebra equus zebra zebra. hartmanns mountain zebra equus zebra hartmannae. subgenus dolichohippus. grévys zebra equus grevyi. an albino zebra in captivity. the plains zebra equus quagga formerly equus burchelli is the most common and has or had about twelve subspecies distributed across much of southern and eastern africa. it or particular subspecies of it have also been known as the common zebra the dauw burchells zebra actually the subspecies equus quagga burchellii chapmans zebra wahlbergs zebra selous zebra grants zebra boehms zebra and the quagga another extinct subspecies equus quagga quagga.. the mountain zebra equus zebra of southwest africa tends to have a sleek coat with a white belly and narrower stripes than the plains zebra. it has two subspecies and is classified as vulnerable.. grévys zebra equus grevyi is the largest type with a long narrow head making it appear rather mulelike. it is an inhabitant of the semiarid grasslands of ethiopia and northern kenya. grévys zebra is the rarest species of zebra around today and is classified as endangered.. although zebra species may have overlapping ranges they do not interbreed. this held true even when the quagga and burchells race of plains zebra shared the same area. in captivity plains zebras have been crossed with mountain zebras. the hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the plains zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern. attempts to breed a grévys zebra stallion to mountain zebra mares resulted in a high rate of miscarriage. in captivity crosses between zebras and other nonzebra equines have produced several distinct hybrids including the zebroid zeedonk zony and zorse.. it was previously believed that zebras were white animals with black stripes since some zebras have white underbellies. however embryological evidence shows that the animals background color is dark and the white stripes and bellies are additions.. a mother nursing her young blends into a stand of deadwood.. the stripes are typically vertical on the head neck forequarters and main body with horizontal stripes at the rear and on the legs of the animal. the zebra crossing is named after the zebras black and white stripes.. it has been suggested that the stripes serve as visual cues and identification. with each striping pattern unique to each individual zebras can recognize one another by their stripes.. others believe that the stripes act as a camouflage mechanism. this is accomplished in several ways. first the vertical striping helps the zebra hide in grass. while seeming absurd at first glance considering that grass is neither white nor black it is supposed to be effective against the zebras main predator the lion which is color blind. theoretically a zebra standing still in tall grass may not be noticed at all by a lion. additionally since zebras are herd animals the stripes may help to confuse predators a number of zebras standing or moving close together may appear as one large animal making it more difficult for the lion to pick out any single zebra to attack. a herd of zebras scattering to avoid a predator will also represent to that predator a confused mass of vertical stripes travelling in multiple directions making it difficult for the predator to track an individual visually as it separates from its herdmates although biologists have never observed lions appearing confused by zebra stripes.. a more recent theory supported by experiment posits that the disruptive colouration is also an effective means of confusing the visual system of the bloodsucking tsetse fly. waage j. k. 1981. how the zebra got its stripes biting flies as selective agents in the evolution of zebra colouration. j. entom. soc. south africa. 44 351 358. alternative theories include that the stripes coincide with fat patterning beneath the skin serving as a thermoregulatory mechanism for the zebra and that wounds sustained disrupt the striping pattern to clearly indicate the fitness of the animal to potential mates.. a zebra walking. like horses zebras walk trot canter and gallop. they are generally slower than horses but their great stamina helps them outpace predators. when chased a zebra will zigzag from side to side making it more difficult for the predator. when cornered the zebra will rear up and kick or bite its attacker.. closeup of a zebra. zebras have excellent eyesight. it is believed that they can see in color. like most ungulates the zebra has its eyes on the sides of its head giving it a wide field of view. zebras also have night vision although not as advanced as that of most of their predators but their hearing compensates.. zebras have great hearing and tend to have larger rounder ears than horses. like horses and other ungulates zebra can turn their ears in almost any direction. in addition to eyesight and hearing zebras have an acute sense of smell and taste.. zebras in tanzania. like most members of the horse family zebras are highly sociable. their social structure however depends on the species. mountain zebras and plains zebras live in groups known as harems consisting of one stallion with up to six mares and their foals. bachelor males either live alone or with groups of other bachelors until they are old enough to challenge a breeding stallion. when attacked by packs of hyenas or wild dogs a zebra group will huddle together with the foals in the middle while the stallion tries to ward them off.. unlike the other zebra species grevys zebras do not have permanent social bonds. a group of these zebras rarely stays together for more than a few months. the foals stay with their mother while the adult male lives alone. however like the other two zebra species bachelor male zebras will organize in groups.. like horses zebras sleep standing up and only sleep when neighbors are around to warn them of predators.. a zebra feeding on grass. zebras communicate with each other with high pitched barks and whinnying. grevys zebras make mulelike brays. a zebras ears signify its mood. when a zebra is in a calm tense or friendly mood its ears stand erect. when it is frightened its ears are pushed forward. when angry the ears are pulled backward. when surveying an area for predators zebras will stand in an alert posture with ears erect head held high and staring. when tense they will also snort. when a predator is spotted or sensed a zebra will bark or bray loudly.. mother and foal at the dallas zoo. zebras are very adaptable grazers. they feed mainly on grasses but will also eat shrubs herbs twigs leaves and bark. their well adapted digestive system allows them to subsist on diets of lower nutritional quality than that necessary for herbivores.. like most animal species female zebras mature earlier than the males and a mare may have her first foal by the age of three. males are not able to breed until the age of five or six. mares may give birth to one foal every twelve months. she nurses the foal for up to a year. like horses zebras are able to stand walk and suckle shortly after theyre born. a zebra foal is brown and white instead of black and white at birth.. plains and mountain zebra foals are protected by their mother as well as the head stallion and the other mares in their group. grevys zebra foals have only their mother as a regular protector since as noted above grevys zebra groups often disband after a few months.. lord rothschild with his famed zebra carriage equus burchelli which he frequently drove through london. attempts have been made to train zebras for riding since they have better resistance than horses to african diseases. however most of these attempts failed due to the zebras more unpredictable nature and tendency to panic under stress. for this reason zebramules or zebroids crosses between any species of zebra and a horse pony donkey or ass are preferred over purebred zebras.. in england the zoological collector lord rothschild frequently used zebras to draw a carriage. in 1907 rosendo ribeiro the first doctor in nairobi kenya used a riding zebra for housecalls. in the mid 1800s governor george grey imported zebras to new zealand from his previous posting in south africa and used them to pull his carriage on his privately owned kawau island.. a tamed zebra being ridden in east africa. captain horace hayes in points of the horse circa 1893 compared the usefulness of different zebra species. in 1891 hayes broke a mature intact mountain zebra stallion to ride in two days time and the animal was quiet enough for his wife to ride and be photographed upon. he found the burchells zebra easy to break in and considered it ideal for domestication as it was immune to the bite of the tsetse fly. he considered the quagga wellsuited to domestication due to being easy to train to saddle and harness. hayes capt. horace 1893 points of the horse pp. 311316 london w. thacker. modern man has had great impact on the zebra population. zebras were and still are hunted mainly for their skins. the cape mountain zebra was hunted to near extinction with less than 100 individuals by the 1930s. however the population has increased to about 700 due to conservation efforts. both mountain zebra subspecies are currently protected in national parks but are still endangered.. zebras on the botswana coat of arms. the grevys zebra is also endangered. hunting and competition from livestock have greatly decreased their population. because of the populations small size environmental hazards such as drought are capable of easily affecting the entire species. plains zebras are much more numerous and have a healthy population. nevertheless they too are threatened by hunting and habitat change from farming. one subspecies the quagga is now extinct.. zebras have been the subject of african folk tales which tell how they got their stripes. according to a bushmen folk tale of namibia the zebra was once all white but got its black stripes after a fight with a baboon over a waterhole. after kicking the baboon so hard the zebra lost his balance and tripped over a fire and the fire sticks left scorches mark all over this white coat. in the film fantasia two centaurs are

appear rather mulelike. it is an inhabitant of the semiarid grasslands of ethiopia and northern kenya. grévys zebra is the rarest species of zebra around today and is classified as endangered.. although zebra species may have overlapping ranges they do not interbreed. this held true even when the quagga and burchells race of plains zebra shared the same area. in captivity plains zebras have been crossed with mountain zebras. the hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the plains zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern. attempts to breed a grévys zebra stallion to mountain zebra mares resulted in a high rate of miscarriage. in captivity crosses between zebras and other nonzebra equines have produced several distinct hybrids including the zebroid zeedonk zony and zorse.. it was previously believed that zebras were white animals with black stripes since some zebras have white underbellies. however embryological evidence shows that the animals background color is dark and the white stripes and bellies are additions.. a mother nursing her young blends into a stand of deadwood.. the stripes are typically vertical on the head neck forequarters and main body with horizontal stripes at the rear and on the legs of the animal. the zebra crossing is named after the zebras black and white stripes.. it has been suggested that the stripes serve as visual cues and identification. with each striping pattern unique to each individual zebras can recognize one another by their stripes.. others believe that the stripes act as a camouflage mechanism. this is accomplished in several ways. first the vertical striping helps the zebra hide in grass. while seeming absurd at first glance considering that grass is neither white nor black it is supposed to be effective against the zebras main predator the lion which is color blind. theoretically a zebra standing still in tall grass may not be noticed at all by a lion. additionally since zebras are herd animals the stripes may help to confuse predators a number of zebras standing or moving close together may appear as one large animal making it more difficult for the lion to pick out any single zebra to attack. a herd of zebras scattering to avoid a predator will also represent to that predator a confused mass of vertical stripes travelling in multiple directions making it difficult for the predator to track an individual visually as it separates from its herdmates although biologists have never observed lions appearing confused by zebra stripes.. a more recent theory supported by experiment posits that the disruptive colouration is also an effective means of confusing the visual system of the bloodsucking tsetse fly. waage j. k. 1981. how the zebra got its stripes biting flies

zebras walk trot canter and gallop. they are generally slower than horses but their great stamina helps them outpace predators. when chased a zebra will zigzag from side to side making it more difficult for the predator. when cornered the zebra will rear up and kick or bite its attacker.. closeup of a zebra. zebras have excellent eyesight. it is believed that they can see in color. like most ungulates the zebra has its eyes on the sides of its head giving it a wide field of view. zebras also have night vision although not as advanced as that of most of their predators but their hearing compensates.. zebras have great hearing and tend to have larger rounder ears than horses. like horses and other ungulates zebra can turn their ears in almost any direction. in addition to eyesight and hearing zebras have an acute sense of smell and taste.. zebras in tanzania. like most members of the horse family zebras are highly sociable. their social structure however depends on the species. mountain zebras and plains zebras live in groups known as harems consisting of one stallion with up to six mares and their foals. bachelor males either live alone or with groups of other bachelors until they are old enough to challenge a breeding stallion. when attacked by packs of hyenas or wild dogs a zebra group will huddle together with the foals in the middle while the stallion tries to ward them off.. unlike the other zebra species grevys zebras do not have permanent social bonds. a group of these zebras rarely stays together for more than a few months. the foals stay with their mother while the adult male lives alone. however like the other two zebra species bachelor male zebras will organize in groups.. like horses zebras sleep standing up and only sleep when neighbors are around to warn them of predators.. a zebra feeding on grass. zebras communicate with each other with high pitched barks and whinnying. grevys zebras make mulelike brays. a zebras ears signify its mood. when a zebra is in a calm tense or friendly mood its ears stand erect. when it is frightened its ears are pushed forward. when angry the ears are pulled backward. when surveying an area for predators zebras will stand in an alert posture with ears erect head held high and staring. when tense they will also snort. when a predator is spotted or sensed a zebra will bark or bray loudly.. mother and foal at the dallas zoo. zebras are very adaptable grazers. they feed mainly on grasses but will also eat shrubs herbs twigs leaves and bark. their well adapted digestive system allows them to subsist on diets of lower nutritional quality than that necessary for herbivores.. like most animal species female zebras mature earlier than the males and a mare may have her first foal by the age of three. males are not able to breed until the age of five or six. mares may give birth to one foal every twelve months. she nurses the foal for up to a year. like horses zebras are able to stand walk and suckle shortly after theyre born. a zebra foal is brown and white instead of black and white at birth.. plains and mountain zebra foals are protected by their mother as well as the head stallion and the other mares in their group. grevys zebra foals have only their mother as a regular protector since as noted above grevys zebra groups often disband after a few months.. lord rothschild with his famed zebra carriage equus burchelli which he frequently drove through london. attempts have been made to train zebras for riding since they have better resistance than horses to african diseases. however most of these attempts failed due to the zebras more unpredictable nature and tendency to panic under stress. for this reason zebramules or zebroids crosses between any species of zebra and a horse pony donkey or ass are preferred over purebred zebras.. in england the zoological collector lord rothschild frequently used zebras to draw a carriage. in 1907 rosendo ribeiro the first doctor in nairobi kenya used a riding zebra for housecalls. in the mid 1800s governor george grey imported zebras to new zealand from his previous posting in south africa and used them to pull his carriage on his privately owned kawau island.. a tamed zebra being ridden in east africa. captain horace hayes in points of the horse circa 1893 compared the usefulness of different zebra species. in 1891 hayes broke a mature intact mountain zebra stallion to ride in two days time and the animal was quiet enough for his wife to ride and be photographed upon. he found the burchells zebra easy to break in and considered it ideal for domestication as it was immune to the bite of the tsetse fly. he considered the quagga wellsuited to domestication due to being easy to train to saddle and harness. hayes capt. horace 1893 points of the horse pp. 311316 london w. thacker. modern man has had great impact on the zebra population. zebras were and still are hunted mainly for their skins. the cape mountain zebra was hunted to near extinction with less than 100 individuals by the 1930s. however the population has increased to about 700 due to conservation efforts. both mountain zebra subspecies are currently protected in national parks but are still endangered.. zebras on the botswana coat of arms. the grevys zebra is also endangered. hunting and competition from livestock have greatly decreased their population. because of the populations small size environmental hazards such as drought are capable of easily affecting the entire species. plains zebras are much more numerous and have a healthy population. nevertheless they too are threatened by hunting and habitat change from farming. one subspecies the quagga is now extinct.. zebras have been the subject of african folk tales which tell how they got their stripes. according to a bushmen folk tale of namibia the zebra was once all white but got its black stripes after a fight with a baboon over a waterhole. after kicking the baboon so hard the zebra lost his balance and tripped over a fire and the fire sticks left scorches mark all over this white coat. in the film fantasia two centaurs are

individual. they are generally social animals and can be seen in small harems to large herds. in addition to their stripes zebras have erect mohawklike manes. unlike their closest relatives horses and asses zebras have never been truly domesticated.. there are three species of zebra the plains zebra grévys zebra and the mountain zebra. the plains zebra and the mountain zebra belong to the subgenus hippotigris but grevys zebra is the sole species of subgenus dolichohippus. the latter resembles an ass while the former two are more horselike. nevertheless dna and molecular data show that zebras do indeed have monophyletic origins. all three belong to the genus equus along with other living equids. in certain regions of kenya plains zebras and grevys zebras coexist.. the unique stripes and behaviors of zebras make these among the animals most familiar to people. they can be found in a variety of habitats such as grasslands savannas woodlands thorny scrublands mountains and coastal hills. however various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations in particular hunting for skins and habitat destruction. grevys zebra and the mountain zebra are endangered. while plains zebras are much more plentiful one subspecies the quagga went extinct in the late nineteenth century.. the name zebra comes from the old portuguese word zevra which means wild ass. the pronunciation is internationally or in north america.. zebras were the second lineage to diverge from the earliest protohorses after the asses around 4 million years ago. grevys zebra is believed to have been the first zebra species to emerge. the ancestors of the equus horses are believed to have been striped and zebras must have retained the stripes of their ancestors due to their advantage for social animals in tropical environments. extensive stripes would be of little use to equids that live in low densities in deserts like asses and some horses or ones that live in colder climates with shaggy coats and annual shading like some horses. fossils of an ancient equid were discovered in the hagerman fossil beds national monument in hagerman idaho. it was named the hagerman horse with a scientific name of equus simplicidens. it is believed to have been similar to the grevys zebra. the animals had stocky zebralike bodies and short narrow donkeylike skulls. grevys zebra also has a donkeylike skull. the hagerman horse is also called the american zebra or hagerman zebra.. zebras in botswana. there are three extant species. collectively two of the species have 8 subspecies 7

loudly.. mother and foal at the dallas zoo. zebras are very adaptable grazers. they feed mainly on grasses but will also eat shrubs herbs twigs leaves and bark. their well adapted digestive system allows them to subsist on diets of lower nutritional quality than that necessary for herbivores.. like most animal species female zebras mature earlier than the males and a mare may have her first foal by the age of three. males are not able to breed until the age of five or six. mares may give birth to one foal every twelve months. she nurses the foal for up to a year. like horses zebras are able to stand walk and suckle shortly after theyre born. a zebra foal is brown and white instead of black and white at birth.. plains and mountain zebra foals are protected by their mother as well as the head stallion and the other mares in their group. grevys zebra foals have only their mother as a regular protector since as noted above grevys zebra groups often disband after a few months.. lord rothschild with his famed zebra carriage equus burchelli which he frequently drove through london. attempts have been made to train zebras for riding since they have better resistance than horses to african diseases. however most of these attempts failed due to the zebras more unpredictable nature and tendency to panic under stress. for this reason zebramules or zebroids crosses between any species of zebra and a horse pony donkey or ass are preferred over purebred zebras.. in england the zoological collector lord rothschild frequently used zebras to draw a carriage. in 1907 rosendo ribeiro the first doctor in nairobi kenya used a riding zebra for housecalls. in the mid 1800s governor george grey imported zebras to new zealand from his previous posting in south africa and used them to pull his carriage on his privately owned kawau island.. a tamed zebra being ridden in east africa. captain horace hayes in points of the horse circa 1893 compared the usefulness of different zebra species. in 1891 hayes broke a mature intact mountain zebra stallion to ride in two days time and the animal was quiet enough for his wife to ride and be photographed upon. he found the burchells zebra easy to break in and considered it ideal for domestication as it was immune to the bite of the tsetse fly. he considered the quagga wellsuited to domestication due to being easy to train to saddle and harness. hayes capt. horace 1893 points of the horse pp. 311316 london w. thacker. modern man has had great impact on the zebra population. zebras were and still are hunted mainly for their skins. the cape mountain zebra was hunted to near extinction with less than 100 individuals by the 1930s. however the population has increased to about 700 due to conservation efforts. both mountain zebra subspecies are currently protected in national parks but are still endangered.. zebras on the botswana coat of arms. the grevys zebra is also endangered. hunting and competition from livestock have greatly decreased their population. because of the populations small size environmental hazards such as drought are capable of easily affecting the entire species. plains zebras are much more numerous and have a healthy population. nevertheless they too are threatened by hunting and habitat change from farming. one subspecies the quagga is now extinct.. zebras have been the subject of african folk tales which tell how they got their stripes. according to a bushmen folk tale of namibia the zebra was once all white but got its black stripes after a fight with a baboon over a waterhole. after kicking the baboon so hard the zebra lost his balance and tripped over a fire and the fire sticks left scorches mark all over this white coat. in the film fantasia two centaurs are

individual. they are generally social animals and can be seen in small harems to large herds. in addition to their stripes zebras have erect mohawklike manes. unlike their closest relatives horses and asses zebras have never been truly domesticated.. there are three species of zebra the plains zebra grévys zebra and the mountain zebra. the plains zebra and the mountain zebra belong to the subgenus hippotigris but grevys zebra is the sole species of subgenus dolichohippus. the latter resembles an ass while the former two are more horselike. nevertheless dna and molecular data show that zebras do indeed have monophyletic origins. all three belong to the genus equus along with other living equids. in certain regions of kenya plains zebras and grevys zebras coexist.. the unique stripes and behaviors of zebras make these among the animals most familiar to people. they can be found in a variety of habitats such as grasslands savannas woodlands thorny scrublands mountains and coastal hills. however various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations in particular hunting for skins and habitat destruction. grevys zebra and the mountain zebra are endangered. while plains zebras are much more plentiful one subspecies the quagga went extinct in the late nineteenth century.. the name zebra comes from the old portuguese word zevra which means wild ass. the pronunciation is internationally or in north america.. zebras were the second lineage to diverge from the earliest protohorses after the asses around 4 million years ago. grevys zebra is believed to have been the first zebra species to emerge. the ancestors of the equus horses are believed to have been striped and zebras must have retained the stripes of their ancestors due to their advantage for social animals in tropical environments. extensive stripes would be of little use to equids that live in low densities in deserts like asses and some horses or ones that live in colder climates with shaggy coats and annual shading like some horses. fossils of an ancient equid were discovered in the hagerman fossil beds national monument in hagerman idaho. it was named the hagerman horse with a scientific name of equus simplicidens. it is believed to have been similar to the grevys zebra. the animals had stocky zebralike bodies and short narrow donkeylike skulls. grevys zebra also has a donkeylike skull. the hagerman horse is also called the american zebra or hagerman zebra.. zebras in botswana. there are three extant species. collectively two of the species have 8 subspecies 7 extant. zebra populations are diverse and the relationships between and the taxonomic status of several of the subspecies are not well known.. genus equus. subgenus hippotigris. plains zebra equus

grévys zebra equus grevyi. an albino zebra in captivity. the plains zebra equus quagga formerly equus burchelli is the most common and has or had about twelve subspecies distributed across much of southern and eastern africa. it or particular subspecies of it have also been known as the common zebra the dauw burchells zebra actually the subspecies equus quagga burchellii chapmans zebra wahlbergs zebra selous zebra grants zebra boehms zebra and the quagga another extinct subspecies equus quagga quagga.. the mountain zebra equus zebra of southwest africa tends to have a sleek coat with a white belly and narrower stripes than the plains zebra. it has two subspecies and is classified as vulnerable.. grévys zebra equus grevyi is the largest type with a long narrow head making it appear rather mulelike. it is an inhabitant of the semiarid grasslands of ethiopia and northern kenya. grévys zebra is the rarest species of zebra around today and is classified as endangered.. although zebra species may have overlapping ranges they do not interbreed. this held true even when the quagga and burchells race of plains zebra shared the same area. in captivity plains zebras have been crossed with mountain zebras. the hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the plains zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern. attempts to breed a grévys zebra stallion to mountain zebra mares resulted in a high rate of miscarriage. in captivity crosses between zebras and other nonzebra equines have produced several distinct hybrids including the zebroid zeedonk zony and zorse.. it was previously believed that zebras were white animals with black stripes since some zebras have white underbellies. however embryological evidence shows that the animals background color is dark and the white stripes and bellies are additions.. a mother nursing her young blends into a stand of deadwood.. the stripes are typically vertical on the head neck forequarters and main body with horizontal stripes at the rear and on the legs of the animal. the zebra crossing is named after the zebras black and white stripes.. it has been suggested that the stripes serve as visual cues and identification. with each striping pattern unique to each individual zebras can recognize one another by their stripes.. others believe that the stripes act as a camouflage mechanism. this is accomplished in several ways. first the vertical striping helps the zebra hide in grass. while seeming absurd at first glance considering that grass is neither white nor black it is supposed to be effective against the zebras main predator the lion which is color blind. theoretically a zebra standing still in tall grass may not be noticed at all by a lion. additionally since zebras are herd animals the stripes may help to confuse predators a number of zebras standing or moving close together may appear as one large animal making it more difficult for the lion to pick out any single zebra to attack. a herd of zebras scattering to avoid a predator will also represent to that predator a confused mass of vertical stripes travelling in multiple directions making it difficult for the predator to track an individual visually as it separates from its herdmates although biologists have never observed lions appearing confused by zebra stripes.. a more recent theory supported by experiment posits that the disruptive colouration is also an effective means of confusing the visual system of the bloodsucking tsetse fly. waage j. k. 1981. how the zebra got its stripes biting flies as selective agents in the evolution of zebra colouration. j. entom. soc. south africa. 44 351 358. alternative theories include that the stripes coincide with fat patterning beneath the skin serving as a thermoregulatory mechanism for the zebra and that wounds sustained disrupt the striping pattern to clearly indicate the fitness of the animal to potential mates.. a zebra walking. like horses zebras walk trot canter and gallop. they are generally slower than horses but their great stamina helps them outpace predators. when chased a zebra will zigzag from side to side making it more difficult for the predator. when cornered the zebra will rear up and kick or bite its attacker.. closeup of a zebra. zebras have excellent eyesight. it is believed that they can see in color. like most ungulates the zebra has its eyes on the sides of its head giving it a wide field of view. zebras also have night vision although not as advanced as that of most of their predators but their hearing compensates.. zebras have great hearing and tend to have larger rounder ears than horses. like horses and other ungulates zebra can turn their ears in almost any direction. in addition to eyesight and hearing zebras have an acute sense of smell and taste.. zebras in tanzania. like most members of the horse family zebras are highly sociable. their social structure however depends on the species. mountain zebras and plains zebras live in groups known as harems consisting of one stallion with up to six mares and their foals. bachelor males either live alone or with groups of other bachelors until they are old enough to challenge a breeding stallion. when attacked by packs of hyenas or wild dogs a zebra group will huddle together with the foals in the middle while the stallion tries to ward them off.. unlike the other zebra species grevys zebras do not have permanent social bonds. a group of these zebras rarely stays together for more than a few months. the foals stay with their mother while the adult male lives alone. however like the other two zebra species bachelor male zebras will organize in groups.. like horses zebras sleep standing up and only sleep when neighbors are around to warn them of predators.. a zebra feeding on grass. zebras communicate with each other with high pitched barks and whinnying. grevys zebras make mulelike brays. a zebras ears signify its mood. when a zebra is in a calm tense or friendly mood its ears stand erect. when it is frightened its ears are pushed forward. when angry the ears are pulled backward. when surveying an area for predators zebras will stand in an alert posture with ears erect head held high and staring. when tense they will also snort. when a predator is spotted or sensed a zebra will bark or bray

[\n          \"lyre. the lyre is a stringed musical instrument well known for its use in classical antiquity and later. the recitations of the ancient greeks were accompanied by lyre playing. the lyre of classical antiquity was ordinarily played by being strummed with a plectrum like a guitar or a zither rather than being plucked like a harp. the fingers of the free hand silenced the unwanted strings in the chord.. lyres from various times and places are regarded by some organologists specialists in the history of musical instruments as a branch of the zither family a general category which includes many different stringed instruments such as lutes guitars kantele and psalteries not just zithers.. others view the lyre and zither as being two separate classes. those specialists maintain that the zither is distinguished by strings spread across all or most of its soundboard or the top surface of its sound chest also called soundbox or resonator as opposed to the lyre whose strings emanate from a more or less common point off the soundboard such as a tailpiece. examples of that difference include a piano a keyed zither and a violin referred to by some as a species of fingerboard lyre. some specialists even argue that instruments such as the violin and guitar belong to a class apart from the lyre because they have no yokes or uprights surmounting their resonators as true lyres have. this group they usually refer to as the lute class after the instrument of that name and include within it the guitar the violin the banjo and similar stringed instruments with fingerboards. those who differ with that opinion counter by calling the lute violin guitar banjo and other such instruments independent fingerboard lyres as opposed to simply fingerboard lyres such as the welsh crwth which have both fingerboards and frameworks above their resonators.. one point on which organologists universally agree is that the distinction between harps on the one hand and zithers and lyres and in some views lutes on the other is that harps have strings emanating directly from the soundboard and residing in a plane that is basically perpendicular to the soundboard as opposed to the other instruments whose strings are attached to one or more points somewhere off the soundboard e.g. wrest pins on a zither tailpiece on a lyre or lute and lie in a plane essentially parallel to it. they also agree that neither the overall size of the instrument nor the number of strings on it have anything to do with its classification. for example small scottish and irish harps can be held on the lap while some ancient sumerian lyres appear to have been as tall as a seated man see kinsky also sachs history ... under references. regarding the number of strings the standard 88key piano has many more strings than even the largest harp.. women posing as a siren with a lyre in 1913.. a classical lyre has a hollow body or soundchest also known as soundbox or resonator. extending from this soundchest are two raised arms which are sometimes hollow and are curved both outward and forward. they are connected near the top by a crossbar or yoke. an additional crossbar fixed to the soundchest forms the bridge which transmits the vibrations of the strings. the deepest note was that farthest from the players body as the strings did not differ much in length more weight may have been gained for the deeper notes by thicker strings as in the violin and similar modern instruments or they were tuned by having a slacker tension. the strings were of gut. they were stretched between the yoke and bridge or to a tailpiece below the bridge. there were two ways of tuning one was to fasten the strings to pegs which might be turned the other was to change the place of the string upon the crossbar probably both expedients were used simultaneously.. statue of the olympian deity apollo holding a lyre.. according to ancient greek mythology the young god hermes created the lyre from a slaughtered cow from apollos sacred herd using the intestines for the strings. lyres were associated with apollonian virtues of moderation and equilibrium contrasting with the dionysian pipes and aulos both of which represented ecstasy and celebration.. locales in southern europe western asia or north africa have been proposed as the historic birthplace of the genus. the instrument is still played in northeastern parts of africa.. some of the cultures using and developing the lyre were the aeolian and ionian greek colonies on the coasts of asia ancient asia minor modern day turkey bordering the lydian empire. some mythic masters like orpheus musaeus and thamyris were believed to have been born in thrace another place of extensive greek colonization.. the name kissar kithara given by the ancient greeks to egyptian box instruments reveals the apparent similarities recognized by greeks themselves. the cultural peak of ancient egypt and thus the possible age of the earliest instruments of this type predates the 5th century classic greece.. this indicates the possibility that the lyre might have existed in one of greeces neighboring countries either thrace lydia or egypt and was introduced into greece at preclassic times.. the number of strings on the classical lyre varied at different epochs and possibly in different localities four seven and ten having been favorite numbers. they were used without a fingerboard no greek description or representation having ever been met with that can be construed as referring to one. nor was a bow possible the flat soundboard being an insuperable impediment. the plectrum however was in constant use. it was held in the right hand to set the upper strings in vibration when not in use it hung from the instrument by a ribbon. the fingers of the left hand touched the lower strings presumably to silence those whose notes were not wanted.. there is no evidence as to the stringing of the greek lyre in the heroic age. plutarch says that olympus and terpander used but three strings to accompany their recitation. as the four strings led to seven and eight by doubling the tetrachord so the trichord is connected with the hexachord or sixstringed lyre depicted on so many archaic greek vases. the accuracy of this representation cannot be insisted upon the vase painters being little mindful of the complete expression of details yet one may suppose their tendency would be rather to imitate than to invent a number. it was their constant practice to represent the strings as being damped by the fingers of the left hand of the player after having been struck by the plectrum which he held in the right hand. before greek civilization had assumed its historic form there was likely to have been great freedom and independence of different localities in the matter of lyre stringing which is corroborated by the antique use of the chromatic halftone and enharmonic quartertone tunings pointing to an early exuberance and perhaps also to an asiatic bias towards refinements of intonation.. while the lyre is no longer played in modern greece the term lyra lives on as the name shared by various regional types of fiddles bowed lutes found throughout the country. there are two basic styles of lyra fiddles 1 a pearshaped instrument with a vaulted back which is found in the greek islands in particular the dodecanese and crete and the northern mainland regions of macedonia and thrace and 2 an instrument with a narrow rectangular cylinder body of the pontic greeks who trace their roots to pontos pontus the black sea region of northern turkey. the pontic greek lyra is also known as kemenche. both types of lyra typically have three strings. they are held vertically upright and bowed horizontally if the player is seated the instruments base rests on the players upper left thigh. the cretan lyra is traditionally played in a duo with the laouto a longneck fretted lute that is strummed like a guitar.. reproduction of the lyre from the royal burial at sutton hoo late 6thearly 7th century ad. other instruments known as lyres have been fashioned and used in europe outside the grecoroman world since at least the early middle ages and one view holds that many modern stringed instruments are lateemerging examples of the lyre class. there is no clear evidence that nongrecoroman lyres were played exclusively with plectra and numerous instruments regarded by some as modern lyres are played with bows.. lyres appearing to have emerged independently of grecoroman prototypes were used by the teutonic gallic scandinavian and celtic peoples over a thousand years ago. dates of origin which probably vary from region to region cannot be determined but the oldest known fragments of such instruments are thought to date from around the sixth century of the common era. after the bow made its way into europe from the middleeast around two centuries later it was applied to several species of those lyres that were small enough to make bowing practical. there came to be two broad classes of bowed european yoke lyres those with fingerboards dividing the open space within the yoke longitudinally and those without fingerboards. the last surviving examples of instruments within the latter class were the scandinavian talharpa and jouhikko. different tones could be obtained from a single bowed string by pressing the fingernails of the players left hand against various points along the string to fret the string.. the last of the bowed yoke lyres with fingerboard was the modern ca. 1485 ca. 1800 welsh crwth. it had several predecessors both in the british isles and in continental europe. pitch was changed on individual strings by pressing the string firmly against the fingerboard with the fingertips. like a violin this method shortened the vibrating length of the string to produce higher tones while releasing the finger gave the string a greater vibrating length thereby producing a tone lower in pitch. this is the principle on which the modern violin and guitar work.. while the dates of origin and other evolutionary details of the european bowed yoke lyres continue to be disputed among organologists there is general agreement that none of them were the ancestors of modern orchestral bowed stringed instruments as once was thought.. in furniture design a lyre arm is a wooden lyreshaped element often used at the front of the arm of a chair typically created as an exposed wooden part of a chair sofa or other furniture piece.. a music holder used by marching bands is also called a lyre for its shape similar to this instrument.. lyre also can denote the framework supporting the foot pedals underneath a piano. the term is most often used in connection with older pianos of ornate designs.. the constellation lyra is said to resemble a lyre shape but it looks more like a lute.. arabian peninsula tanb\\u016bra.

are mostly aquatic birds mostly smaller than their relatives the swans and geese and may be found in both fresh water and sea water.. most ducks have a wide flat beak adapted for dredging. they exploit a variety of food sources such as grasses aquatic plants fish insects small amphibians photo of a duck eating a frog worms and small molluscs.. ducks are sometimes confused with several types of unrelated water birds with similar forms such as loons or divers grebes gallinules and coots.. many species of duck are temporarily flightless while moulting they seek out protected habitat with good food supplies during this period. this moult typically precedes migration.. some duck species mainly those breeding in the temperate and arctic northern hemisphere are migratory those in the tropics however are generally not. some ducks particularly in australia where rainfall is patchy and erratic are nomadic seeking out the temporary lakes and pools that form after localised heavy rain.. diving ducks and sea ducks forage deep underwater. to be able to submerge more easily the diving ducks are heavier than dabbling ducks and therefore have more difficulty taking off to fly..

taking off to fly.. dabbling ducks feed on the surface of water or on land or as deep as they can reach by upending without completely submerging.. along the inside of the beak they have tiny rows of plates called lamellae like a whales baleen. these let them filter water out of the side of their beaks and keep food inside.. a few specialized species such as the smew goosander and the mergansers are adapted to catch large fish.. in the mallard the tongue is a flat plate and on the tongues back end is a short liftable flap with about 18 short spikes on for pushing struggling prey and other food down its throat.. the males drakes of northern species often have extravagant plumage but that is moulted in summer to give a more femalelike appearance the eclipse plumage. southern resident

the nest by mammals e.g. foxes and large birds including hawks and eagles.. adult ducks are fast fliers but may be caught on the water by large aquatic predators. this can occasionally include fish

        "Type 1 diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes, is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. This results in little to no insulin production, necessitating lifelong insulin therapy for those affected. It usually manifests in childhood or adolescence, although it can occur at any age. The exact cause of Type 1 diabetes is unknown, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors, such as viral infections.\n",

        "Type 2 diabetes, the most common form, typically develops in adults over the age of 45, though it is increasingly being diagnosed in younger populations, including children, adolescents, and young adults. It is primarily associated with insulin resistance, a condition in which the body's cells do not respond properly to insulin, combined with an eventual decline in insulin production. Risk factors for Type 2 diabetes include obesity, physical inactivity, poor diet, and a family history of diabetes. Unlike Type 1, Type 2 diabetes can often be managed with lifestyle changes such as improved diet, increased physical activity, and weight loss, although medications or insulin therapy may also be necessary.\n",

Chronic high blood sugar levels can cause damage to blood vessels, leading to cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke, as well as microvascular complications affecting the eyes (retinopathy), kidneys (nephropathy), and nerves (neuropathy). Diabetic neuropathy can result in pain, tingling, and loss of sensation in the extremities, which, combined with poor circulation, increases the risk of foot ulcers and infections, potentially leading to amputations.\n",

        "Effective management of diabetes involves a multifaceted approach. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is crucial for making informed treatment decisions. A balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, helps maintain blood sugar levels within the target range. Physical activity enhances insulin sensitivity and aids in weight management. Medications, whether oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin, are often necessary to achieve optimal glucose control. Education and support from healthcare providers enable individuals with diabetes to understand their condition and take proactive steps in managing it.\n",

Regardless of the type, uncontrolled diabetes can lead to a multitude of complications. Chronic high blood sugar levels can cause damage to blood vessels, leading to cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke, as well as microvascular complications affecting the eyes (retinopathy), kidneys (nephropathy), and nerves (neuropathy). Diabetic neuropathy can result in pain, tingling, and loss of sensation in the extremities, which, combined with poor circulation, increases the risk of foot ulcers and infections, potentially leading to amputations. Effective management of diabetes involves a multifaceted approach. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is crucial for making informed treatment decisions. A balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, helps maintain blood sugar levels within the target range. Physical activity enhances insulin sensitivity and aids in weight management. Medications, whether oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin, are often necessary to achieve optimal glucose control.

            "[\"Diabetes mellitus, commonly referred to as diabetes, is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (blood sugar), which over time leads to serious damage to various organs and tissues of the body. There are three main types of diabetes: Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes. Each type has distinct etiologies, but all involve the body's inability to effectively regulate blood sugar levels. Type 1 diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes, is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. This results in little to no insulin production, necessitating lifelong insulin therapy for those affected. It usually manifests in childhood or adolescence, although it can occur at any age. The exact cause of Type 1 diabetes is unknown, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors, such as viral infections. Type 2 diabetes, the most common form, typically develops in adults over the age of 45, though it is increasingly being diagnosed in younger populations, including children, adolescents, and young adults. It is primarily associated with insulin resistance, a condition in which the body's cells do not respond properly to insulin, combined with an eventual decline in insulin production. Risk factors for Type 2 diabetes include obesity, physical inactivity, poor diet, and a family history of diabetes. Unlike Type 1, Type 2 diabetes can often be managed with lifestyle changes such as improved diet, increased physical activity,\", \"as viral infections.

Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy and is characterized by high blood sugar levels that were not present before pregnancy.
